To use the Voluntarily platform you will participate in a suite of tools and processes for:

Identity - ensuring people are who they say they are.

Screening - processes for analysing the information gathered and identifying suitable candidates – in this case, those who can be relied on to keep children safe.

Vetting - the formal process of obtaining checks from another agency, e.g., the Police Vetting Service, criminal conviction history checks.

Tracking - identifying volunteer activities that involve working with children and signalling to activity organisers the status of the people volunteering.

Consent or non-consent for the current employer to be contacted.

A declaration of whether or not they have been convicted of a criminal offence, which is not eligible to be concealed under the Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Act 2004 and space to provide an explanation.
