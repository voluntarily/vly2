# Voluntarily Privacy Policy

### Introduction

Voluntarily is an online platform that connects volunteers with those asking for help.

Voluntarily is an initiative by the Pam Fergusson Charitable Trust (PFCT, we, our, or us) with support from Datacom, The Ministry of Education, Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED), Spark Foundation, NZ Government Innovation Fund and many leading NZ corporates.

We comply with the New Zealand Privacy Act 1993 (the Act) when dealing with personal information. Personal information is information about an identifiable individual (a natural person).

The purpose of this privacy policy is to let users of the Voluntarily websites at voluntarily.nz and voluntari.ly (Website) know when we collect personal information and what we do with it. We don’t use, share or transfer personal information in connection with the site except as set out in this policy, or as otherwise set out somewhere on the site (including in terms linking to the site).

You are not required to provide personal information to us, although in some cases if you choose not to do so then we will be unable to make certain sections of the Website available to you. For example, we need to have your contact information in order to allow you to request or volunteer help through the Website or to provide you with updates.

When you provide personal information to us, we will comply with the New Zealand Privacy Act 1993 (Act). This policy does not limit or exclude any of your rights under the Act. If you wish to seek further information on the Act, see www.privacy.org.nz.

### Changes to this policy

We may change this policy by uploading a revised policy onto the Website. The change will apply from the date that we upload the revised policy.

### What information do we collect?

#### User Provided Information

We collect the information that you provide when you register to use Voluntarily. Registration with Voluntarily is mandatory in order to use Voluntarily.

When you register with Voluntarily you provide your [name, email address, physical address, contact telephone number and an outline of the help that you are asking for or can offer].

#### Automatically Collected Information

We may also collect technical information whenever you log on to, or visit the public version of, the Website. This may include users’ IP addresses, information about the way users arrive at, browse through and interact with the Website. We may collect this type of technical information through the use of cookies and other means. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive to enable our systems to recognise your browser. If you want to disable cookies, you may do so by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you do so, you may not be able to use all of the functions on the Website. We use the technical information we collect to have a better understanding of the way people use the Website, to improve the way it works and to personalise it to be more relevant and useful to your particular needs. [We may also use this information to assist in making any advertising we display on the Website more personalised and applicable to your interests.]

### Who do we collect your personal information from?

#### We collect personal information about you from:

* you, when you provide that personal information to us, including via the website and any related service, through any registration or subscription process, through any contact with us (e.g. telephone call or email), or when you buy or use our services and products

* third parties where you have authorised this or the information is publicly available.

If possible, we will collect personal information from you directly.

### How we use your personal information

The personal information we collect about you (including any information provided if you register for an account) may be used:

* to verify your identity

* to vet you (see further details below)

* to communicate with you

* to make recommendations to you for volunteering activities

* to connect you to persons asking for help

* for research statistical analysis [(on an anonymised basis)];

* [to market products and services to you]

* to allow people asking for help to learn about who will be working with them and with other persons with whom a volunteer may be in contact

* to improve Voluntarily

* to protect and/or enforce our legal rights and interests, including defending any claim

* for any other purpose authorised by you or the Act.

### Disclosing your personal information

Generally, we do not disclose personal information to third parties for them to use for their own purposes. However, some of the circumstances in which we may do this are:

* to service providers and other persons working with us to make the Website available or improve or develop its functionality (e.g. we may use a third party supplier to host the Website);

* to persons asking for help for the purpose of finding the best volunteers and to enable a successful volunteering relationship

* to your employer for the purpose of tracking volunteering that you have undertaken

* where required by applicable law or any court, or in response to a legitimate request by a law enforcement agency

Any personal information you provide to us may be stored on the secure servers of our trusted service providers, which may be located outside New Zealand. This may involve the transfer of your personal information to countries which have less legal protection for personal information than New Zealand.

[Confidential information held by us in relation to the users business will not be disclosed to a connected business unless authorised by the administrator of the business to which the information relates.]

### Vetting

Effective screening, as part of a comprehensive organisational safety policy, can help identify potentially unsuitable people before they have the opportunity to do harm to others or allow harm to be perpetrated by others. To use the Voluntarily platform you may be required to participate in a suite of tools and processes for:

* Identity - ensuring people are who they say they are.

* Screening - processes for analysing the information gathered and identifying suitable candidates – in this case, those who can be relied on to keep other people safe.

* Vetting - the formal process of obtaining checks from another agency, e.g., the Police vetting service, criminal conviction history checks.

* Tracking - identifying volunteer activities that involve working with other people and signalling to activity organisers the status of the people volunteering.

We may request specific information from users including:

* Consent or non-consent for the current employer to be contacted.

* A declaration of whether or not they have been convicted of a criminal offence, which is not eligible to be concealed under the Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Act 2004 and space to provide an explanation.

* Consent to undertake a Criminal Conviction History Check or Police Vet, using the required forms.

* Any other necessary disclosures, for example, details of professional registration status and any previous employment or professional disciplinary history that could be relevant to safety of other persons.

[This information may be disclosed to persons asking for help to ensure the safety of that person and other persons with whom a volunteer may be in contact.]

### Protecting your personal information

We will take reasonable steps to keep your personal information safe from loss, unauthorised activity, or other misuse.

### Accessing and correcting your personal information

Subject to certain grounds for refusal set out in the Act, you have the right to request access to and correction of any of the personal information we hold about you. Before you exercise this right, we will need evidence to confirm that you are the individual to whom the personal information relates.

In respect of a request for correction, if we think the correction is reasonable and we are reasonably able to change the personal information, we will make the correction. If we do not make the correction, we will take reasonable steps to note on the personal information that you requested the correction.

If you would like to exercise these rights, please email us at hello@voluntarily.nz. Your email should provide evidence of who you are and set out the details of your request (e.g. the personal information, or the correction, that you are requesting).

### Internet use

While we take reasonable steps to maintain secure internet connections, if you provide us with personal information over the internet, the provision of that information is at your own risk.

If you follow a link on the Website to another site, the owner of that site will have its own privacy policy relating to your personal information. We suggest you review that site’s privacy policy before you provide personal information.
