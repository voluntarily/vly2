## Contribute
You can fork the code and submit a pull request but we would prefer you to join the team and work on branches in the main repository. 

To do this please first complete https://voluntarily.atlassian.net/browse/VP-82 As a developer I can check out the code base, build and run it, and make a simple change
Adding your name to the CONTRIBUTORS File indicates that you are submitting your code changes to the project under the open source licence MPL-2.0

Then ask in Gitter for a suitable Jira ticket to work on. 
It is _always_ ok to increase test coverage and we encourage everyone to write automated tests to help understand the code base, find bugs and increase overall quality.

Work on a (short lived) branch labelled with the Jira ticket id e.g. task/VP-82/contributing. Submit a PR and we will endeavour to merge within a day.
After your first commit we will add you to the GitHub Team so that you can branch within the project.
