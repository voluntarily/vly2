# uses ECS command line to start the containers in the cluster based on the given docker compose yml file. 
# this one starts production server using atlas database.
# will only work if you have an IAM account on AWS which is in our security group. 
# and have setup local key etc.
# run this as 
# source aws/service up
# source aws/service down
ecs-cli compose --verbose  --file docker-compose-ecs-atlas.yml service $1

# note this creates a new task definition from the yml file and so you only really need to do this is the parameters have changed. 
# Otherwise you should be able to deploy a new container by draining the stack and starting new instances.
