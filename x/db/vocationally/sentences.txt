The Wal-Mart strategy required and fostered the development of a company-wide computer system to track incoming and outgoing shipments to the various stores.
In Angela and Tom’s case, sandwiching concentrated time with Victor and Jeannine between work and other obligations, which often took precedence over family rituals, meant that routines that signal parental caring and that are major sources of development went by the wayside.
The new approaches are numerous—some more concerned with motor skills, others with cognitive competencies, and still others with emotional and social development.

Diapausing embryos of the orthopteran Austroicetes cruciata undergo slow development for the first two months of diapause, before entering a resting stage [ 24 ] . Similarly, caterpillars of Cirphus unipunctata and Laphygma exigua continue to feed and develop during diapause, albeit at a much-reduced rate [ 25 ] , and caterpillars of the corn-stalk borer Sesamia nonagriodes undergo non-stationary moults during diapause [ 26 ] . These examples hint that the expression of diapause-controlled dormancy may vary between species [ 2 ] . Consequently, diapause could be considered extreme regulation of developmental rate, rather than a shutting down of morphological development.
To determine the influence of temperature on the progression of development we stored the eggs under three temperature regimes, all with the same 13L:11D photoperiod: (1) 4°C in the light and 0°C in the dark; (2) constant 10°C; (3) constant 16°C.

While the CASP experiments provide for an environment where rapid testing of ideas is possible in a rigourous manner, a lot of the development is ad hoc, guided by intuition, and not all parameter choices are explored thoroughly.
Because folliculogenesis in the murine proceeds to the preovulatory stage in the absence of BMP-6 [ 30 ] , BMP-15 [ 15 ] , and BMPR-IB [ 31 ] , one can assume that the marked increases in these regulatory molecules are not essential for the development of a second layer of GC.

In the last several years, the business and corporate community has recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to the development of a competent workforce.
Although these changes have provided strong motivation for increased channel coordination, the development and implementation of key facilitating technologies—like bar codes, the later spread of EDI, and automated distribution centers—have been the real movers here.
Chapters 3 through 5 analyze developments in the retail sector.
After this introduction, Chapter 2 (“The Past as Prologue”) offers a brief history of recent technological and human resource developments in retailing, apparel production—including the role of jobbers, contractors, and manufacturers—and textile enterprises.
Although these developments are very much a work in progress, information-integrated channels of production and distribution are emerging.
The developments reported here offer a prototype of the new links among manufacturers, other suppliers, retailers, and consumers.
This stream of general debate, however, is seldom related to a detailed study or analysis of the impact of such developments on the U.S. textile or apparel industries.
But the longer term viability of American textile centers will depend on the development of infrastructures capable of supporting advanced textile production in countries close to the U.S. market, such as Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America.
Adoption of just-in-time inventory management by manufacturers also represents a significant development, since changes in inventories have often been an important source of business-cycle fluctuations.
But these initiatives are still at an early stage of development.
Finally, the central role played by retailers in development and operation of the channel points to the fact that any measure—whether taken by the government, through voluntary compliance programs or via collective bargaining—must include their participation and support.
Now point-of-sales information provides retailers with reliable information on market developments and hence gives them more leverage in dealing with direct suppliers and others further from ultimate consumers.
A number of developments, many linked to issues we have discussed, indicate both the potential and limitations of electronic retailing.
47 Thus, although Internet retailing will certainly grow as a channel of distribution, the most essential longer term developments will involve the expansion of lean retailing principles to a wider and wider variety of goods sold by a decreasing number of major retailers.
In a related vein, the future of domestic producers also relies on their development of capabilities for supplying fashion products on a replenishment basis.
Once again, the development of Web sites to undertake some of these connections represents an important first step in this direction.
His story underscores the international role of textiles and apparel, their impetus in national economic development, and their place in conflicts over domestic production and imports—a theme that recurs throughout U.S. history.
This brief historical survey highlights not only the crucial developments that still undergird these industries but also the systems and work practices from an earlier era that no longer match today’s competitive requirements.
Other factors drove the development of mass retail as well.
Only in the 1980s, with the development of another system of mass distribution that includes new technology, new management methods, and new links to manufacturing—lean retailing—did the role of the buyer significantly diminish.

In my three decades of teaching university courses in child development, I have come to know thousands of students, many of whom were parents or who became parents soon after completing my class.
As a byproduct of those experiences, parents repeatedly approached me with concerns about how to foster their child’s development in the early years.
At an even more fundamental level, contemporary parents have begun to doubt their own ecacy in their children’s development.
Second, information about child development disseminated to parents is increasingly voluminous but at the same time contradictory.
In view of these diculties, it is little wonder that so many American parents express a sense of powerlessness and inadequacy when it comes to aecting their children’s development.
3 An obvious solution to reconciling parents’ employment needs with young children’s rearing needs is to make high-quality, nonparental care, with characteristics known to promote healthy psychological development, widely available and aordable.
In a recent survey of parents whose children were enrolled in several hundred randomly chosen child-care centers across four states, over 90 percent believed that their preschoolers’ experiences were far better than experts in early childhood development judged those experiences to be.
8 Instead, positive, supportive parenting that endured, even when it marked a change from an early period of parental retreat or negative interaction, was linked to favorable child development, including persistence in problem solving, high self-esteem, socially skilled behavior, closer friendships, and better peer relationships.
Although the precise extent of family–work conﬂict in American culture is not clear, its presence and detrimental impact on parent-child interaction and children’s development are well founded.
Studies carried out during the 1970s and 1980s on the relationship of maternal employment to children’s development revealed many positive outcomes—higher self-esteem, better grades in school, more positive family and peer relations, and less gender-stereotyped beliefs.
17 But repeatedly, eective parenting mediated these favorable developments.
When employed parents spend generous amounts of time engaged with their child, they safeguard the child’s development.
Probably because it reduces work overload, part-time maternal employment is associated with better academic and social development than is full-time employment.
Precious few of these parenting manuals are grounded in the explosion of contemporary research on child development that is of signiﬁcant applied value.
27 The roots of these polarized perspectives can be found in centuries-old, dramatically opposing philosophies about the nature of children and child development.
The behaviorist presumption that development can be mechanically engineered by social input, guaranteeing brighter, socially more mature children, is not borne out by the evidence.
In the tradition of Rousseau, the psychoanalysts argued that powerful biological forces channel development through four psychosexual stages.
Swiss biologist Jean Piaget, twentieth-century giant of cognitive development, proposed a theory in which an intrinsically motivated child acts on the world, noticing discrepancies between the environment and inner structures, or ways of thinking.
In contrast to the behaviorist emphasis on adult tutoring, Piaget believed that since development follows a natural, internally controlled stage sequence, what comes from within the child is paramount in guiding cognitive change.
Piaget’s contribution to the ﬁeld of child development is enormous.
Especially important, Piaget convinced the academic community—as well as many parents and teachers—that children are active contributors to their own development, have their own ways of understanding the world, and must be developmentally ready if teaching is to be successful.
Rather than tracking how well pupils keep pace with norms, or the average performance of same-age peers, open-classroom teachers evaluate children on an individual basis—in relation to their own prior development.
As our discussion already suggests, a central Piagetian tenet is that it is foolhardy to try to speed up development.
Because Piaget stressed the supremacy of children’s engagement with their surroundings over adult teaching, parents’ and teachers’ contributions to development are severely reduced relative to the child’s.
37 This, along with the cross-cultural ﬁndings just described, raises doubts about Piaget’s assumption that discovery learning rather than adult teaching is the most eective way to foster development.
As Damon’s message suggests, in building an eective vision of child development and child rearing, neither the child’s inner thoughts and feelings nor the role of adult guidance can be singularly extolled or wholeheartedly ignored.
Today, sound theories and educational strategies exist that are neither adult- nor child-centered but, instead, portray both as participating actively, jointly, and inseparably in the process of development.
On only one point is the popular parenting literature unanimous: the vital importance of getting development o to a good start during the preschool years.
After decades of theoretical division and debate, a new, more complex view of child development is coalescing in the ﬁeld, supported by rapidly accumulating research evidence.
The fragmented, polarized theories of the past are giving way to more equitable theories emphasizing that the child and the social environment interact and that the contributions of each to development cannot be separated and weighted in a simplistic, one-sided manner.
A second step is an appreciation of the multiplicity of factors that contribute to development—an understanding that spells out parents’ vital role yet clariﬁes how it joins with other forces to aect children’s development and well-being.
child development: a new consensus
At the dawn of a new millennium, a fresh set of theories of child development has blossomed.
Many Factors Contribute to Development
These elements include the child’s heredity and biological constitution; the people and objects in the child’s everyday settings of home, child-care center, school, and neighborhood; community resources for child rearing (such as family-friendly workplace policies and high-quality, aordable child care); and cultural values and customs related to child development and education.
A common human genetic heritage and basic regularities in children’s physical and social environments yield certain universal, broad outlines of development.
Within this dynamic system in which inner and outer forces jointly engender development, each contributing factor inﬂuences—and is inﬂuenced by—the others.
brain development.
How does early experience join with biology to aect brain development?
Notice how, for the biological side of brain development to go forward, appropriate stimulation is essential while formation of neural connections is at its peak.
Because of rapid brain growth and gradual decline in brain plasticity, the ﬁrst 5 to 8 years of life are regarded as a sensitive phase of development in which appropriate stimulation is necessary for children to reach their full genetic potential.
In Burton White and Robert Held’s classic study of the impact of early stimulation on development, young babies in a barren institution given a moderate amount of stimulation tailored to their ability to handle it—at ﬁrst, a few simple designs on the side of their crib and later, a fancy mobile—reached for and explored objects six weeks earlier than did infants given nothing to look at.
Our rapidly expanding knowledge base on brain development and children’s learning reveals that a genetically inﬂuenced roadmap for brain growth and a developmentally appropriate environment go hand in hand; the impact of each depends on the other.
Let’s see how temperament combines with brain development and experience, forming a complex, dynamic system that shapes the course of development.

To chart the development of shy and sociable children, psychologist Jerome Kagan followed several hundred youngsters from infancy into the school years, repeatedly observing their behavior and measuring their physiological responses to highly stimulating, unfamiliar events.
Shy and sociable children also require dierent adult interventions to promote exploration of their surroundings—an activity that (as Piaget pointed out) is essential for optimal cognitive development.
Finally, culture aects the likelihood that parents and teachers will respond to shy children in ways that foster their development.
Environmental forces, from adult–child interaction to cultural values, join with heredity to aect the development of children with other temperamental dispositions as well.
Throughout this book—and especially in Chapter 5, which addresses the development of children with physical and mental disabilities—we will see many more examples of these synergistic eects.
Indeed, many eminent child development researchers have countered Harris’s thesis.
Furthermore, no conclusive evidence exists for the assertion that the most consequential environment for children’s development is the peer group rather than the family.
In fact, this overriding emphasis on peers as a source of positive development is itself a product of our culture.
It leads parents, like Noah and Suzanne, who are on the cusp of a dramatic period of development in their 2-year-old son’s life, to express grave doubts about their own importance.
The central idea of sociocultural theory is that the child and his or her social surroundings join to provide direction to development; participation in social life guides and energizes the child’s mastery of new, culturally adaptive skills.
78 By the 1980s, many American psychologists and educators—doubting the Piagetian view of development and desiring to account for wide variation in children’s competencies—embraced Vygotsky’s ideas with enthusiasm.
These undergo a natural course of development through direct contact with the environment during the ﬁrst two years of life, similar to the process of exploration and discovery described by Piaget.
The milestones just cited are broad universals of development.
This leads to a crucial change in development.
The natural line of development makes closer contact with its surrounding social context, merges with it, and is transformed by it.
Vygotsky emphasized that to understand children’s development, it is necessary to understand the social situations adults devise for them.
Because Vygotsky regarded language as the major bridge between our social and mental worlds, he viewed language acquisition as the most signiﬁcant milestone in children’s cognitive development.
The sociocultural vision is very dierent from behaviorism, which views development as directly imposed, or shaped, by external forces.
The core lesson to be learned from our discussion so far is that development is a matter of children’s genetic/biological potential undergoing a cultural metamorphosis, a process that cannot take place without parents and teachers as thoughtful and committed participants in children’s lives.
From the sociocultural perspective, parents and teachers are leaders in awakening children’s minds and fostering their development; children are apprenticed to these experts.
Vygotsky, who studied and wrote about children’s development in Russia in the early twentieth century, was deeply interested in how interdependency—children’s close ties to their community—can pave the way to competence and autonomy.
An overwhelming consensus of research shows that sensitive caregiving—responding to the baby’s cries for physical care and stimulation promptly, consistently, and appropriately—supports the development of a secure attachment relationship.
To answer this question, Vygotsky proposed a special concept: the zone of proximal development.
Keeping it in mind can help parents and teachers interact with children in ways that lead their development forward.
Vygotsky deﬁned the zone of proximal development as the distance between the child’s actual development (the tasks the child can do individually) and the child’s potential development, “determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers.”

Vygotsky deﬁned the zone of proximal development as the distance between the child’s actual development (the tasks the child can do individually) and the child’s potential development, “determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers.”
Research documents several communicative ingredients that consistently foster development, in children of diverse ages and across a wide range of tasks.
This joint attention to objects and events fosters early language development.
Mothers who maintain high levels of it during play have infants who comprehend more language, produce meaningful gestures and words earlier, and show faster vocabulary development between 1 and 2 years of age.
The communicative competence inherent in intersubjectivity blossoms within a zone of proximal development in which parents and other signiﬁcant adults are “stimulating, attentive, conﬁrmatory, interpretive, and highly supportive.”
37 Parent–child intersubjectivity makes a vital contribution to the development of attachment, attention, language, and understanding of others’ perspectives.
To promote development, the adult varies his or her assistance to ﬁt the child’s changing level of performance, with the goal of keeping the child in the “zone.”
41 Indeed, self-regulation is so important for children’s cognitive and social development that we will return to it repeatedly in later chapters when we consider how other experiences—children’s self-directed language, make-believe play, and learning in school—contribute to it.
Children’s conversations with elaborative-style parents increase in complexity as language development proceeds, creating a zone of proximal development in which narrative competence expands.
Children’s conversations with elaborative-style parents increase in complexity as language development proceeds, creating a zone of proximal development in which narrative competence expands.
“ 68 Furthermore, the richness of 6-year-olds’ evaluative remarks can be predicted from their mother’s evaluative statements in an adult–child conversation 3 years earlier69—a ﬁnding that underscores, once again, parents’ vital role in creating a “zone” for narrative development.
According to psychologist Jerome Bruner, learning to negotiate diering viewpoints through narrative is a crowning achievement of human development.
Gratifying social ties, in turn, serve as vital contexts for further cognitive and social development.
Research consistently demonstrates that language development in early childhood is strongly related to later reading competence—and to academic achievement in general during elementary school.
Conversations with adults are especially powerful contributors to early childhood language proﬁciency and, in turn, to literacy development.
Typically, an adult reads while a child listens—a format that is beneﬁcial to early literacy development93 but that cannot guarantee the child’s attention, involvement, and comprehension.
When parents and teachers use dialogic reading consistently over several weeks to several months, children show gains in language development, print knowledge, and writing progress that are still present six months to a year later.
Indeed, joint participation in make-believe with more expert cultural members is so important for development during early childhood that I devote an entire chapter to it.
Although grocery shopping with Ricky might take 10 or 15 minutes longer than otherwise, it has wide-ranging beneﬁts for his development.
104 Scores on that instrument consistently predict early childhood mental development, no matter what the child’s socioeconomic or ethnic background.
Despite widespread public concern about the impact of TV on children’s development, many parents do little to regulate or guide their children’s viewing.
Parents who intervene in their child’s TV viewing so it is in keeping with the “zone” transform the TV medium from a negative to a positive force in the child’s mental life, and they promote favorable cognitive and social development in many other ways as well.
120 Although the family, Bronfenbrenner noted, continues to have primary responsibility for children’s character development, it lacks the strength needed to do the job because parents and children no longer spend enough time together.
Such togetherness aects a child’s development in countless ways, even through what appear to be triﬂing pursuits—help with homework; outings to the grocery store, the park, and the local library; dinnertime conversations; discussions of exciting or scary TV shows; and bedtime stories.
Narrative conversation also fosters language development and emergent literacy, which greatly ease the task of learning to read and write when children get to school.
Through dialogues with children, adults play a formative role in the development of children’s self-conceptions, sensitivity to others, cognition, academic knowledge, morality, social skills, and capacity to use language to gain control over thought and behavior.
In the next chapter, I address a question that has long intrigued child development theorists and puzzled many parents and teachers: Why do children talk to themselves?
Eminent child development theorists of the past attached great importance to the role of make-believe play in early development.
Eminent child development theorists of the past attached great importance to the role of make-believe play in early development.
Nevertheless, Piaget was convinced that by itself, make-believe play does little to advance children’s development.
Sociodramatic play, involving joint make-believe with a partner, Piaget claimed, is not under way until age 3. As with other aspects of Piaget’s theory, the direction of development for make-believe is from purely individual, egocentric symbols to social play and shared understanding.
Vygotsky’s theory has been the wellspring of our recent appreciation of the profoundly social nature of even very young children’s imaginative play—and its wide-ranging inﬂuence on cognitive and social development.
Vygotsky’s View: A Zone of Proximal Development
Consider the following frequently quoted remarks, taken from a brief lecture in which Vygotsky eloquently summed up his conviction that pretend play is a central force in children’s development:
[Make-believe] play creates a zone of proximal development in the child.
As in the focus of a magnifying glass, play contains all developmental tendencies in condensed form and is itself a major source of development.
How do the make-believe scenes just described, and others like them, serve as major sources of development?
Together, these features make fantasy play a supreme contributor to the development of self-regulation—one that extends the impact of adult teaching and example more than any other early childhood activity.
To understand make-believe play’s role in development, let’s take a closer look at each of its unique features.
10 In helping children disengage thought from reality, pretend play is vital preparation for the much later development of abstract thinking, in which symbols are manipulated and hypothetical ideas are evaluated without referring to currently existing, real world conditions.
As we will see shortly, people renowned for their creative accomplishments often report that make-believe play was a frequent, highly inﬂuential aspect of their early development.
Vygotsky regarded the sociodramatic play of the preschool years as essential for further development of play—speciﬁcally, for movement toward game play in middle childhood.
Children retain both aspects of play, in changing balances, throughout development.
In sum, the development of play proceeds from make-believe, with an overt imaginary situation and covert rules, to organized games, with overt rules and a covert imaginary situation.
The vast yet nearly effortless learning that takes place through pretending makes it, for Vygotsky, “the highest level of preschool development.
contributions of make-believe play to development
Was he correct that pretending in early childhood has a far-reaching impact on development, supporting the emergence and reﬁnement of a wide variety of competencies?
Comparisons of preschoolers’ sociodramatic activities with their social nonpretend pursuits, such as drawing pictures or putting puzzles together in the company of agemates, supports Vygotsky’s view of make-believe as a “zone” in which children enhance their own development.
In view of these ﬁndings, it is not surprising that 4- and 5-year-olds who spend more time at sociodramatic play are advanced in intellectual development and are judged more socially competent by their teachers.
Yet attention becomes more sustained over early childhood—a development that equips children for concentrated involvement, which will be essential for success once they enter school.
What does research say about the role of make-believe in children’s literacy development?
In one of the most extensive studies tracing the development of make-believe play, psychologists Wendy Haight and Peggy Miller followed nine children from 1 to 4 years of age, repeatedly visiting their homes to make intensive observations of their pretending.
Relentlessly barraging children with information that communicates “at” rather than “with” them fails to involve them in dialogue and interferes with optimum development of play.
In sum, quality of adult–child social engagement, both within and outside of make-believe play, has much to do with the potential of such play to lead children’s development forward.
Vygotsky’s theory tells us that adults are active agents in children’s social development.
Martha Bronson’s The Right Stuff for Children Birth to Age 880 is an excellent resource for selecting play materials that support development in early childhood.
Six- to 8-year-olds continue to like role play, and teachers can use it to foster their academic development.
As leaders in children’s development, parents and teachers are in a prime position to design and inﬂuence children’s play worlds in ways that shield them from acquiring materialistic and violent attitudes and behaviors and that accentuate play’s cognitive, emotional, and social beneﬁts.
These include one-sided, contradictory messages in the parenting-advice literature; career pressures that impinge on parent involvement in children’s lives; abysmally weak American child-care services to assist employed parents in their child-rearing roles; cultural violence and excessive materialism permeating children’s worlds; schools with less than optimal conditions for children’s learning; and impediments to granting children with deﬁcits and disabilities social experiences that maximize their development.
In that survey, I asked parents to list any questions about young children’s development and learning that interested or worried them.
When parents are familiar with principles that are grounded in contemporary theory and research on children’s development, they can better deal with the quandaries generated by the changing home, school, and community contexts in which today’s children grow up.
Although self-esteem and favorable development are related, high self-esteem does not necessarily cause effortful behavior and achievement.
Parents who deliver praise not based on real attainment actually undermine their child’s development.
Fortunately, children can just as easily absorb worthwhile messages and information from TV, so parental guidance in this area can have great beneﬁts for development.
The warmth, exploration, conversation, and fun involved in this and other joint parent–child activities strengthen emotional bonds and foster both cognitive and social development.
A common parental worry is that computers will channel children into solitary pursuits and disrupt their social development.
How can parents capitalize on the computer’s potential for spurring their child’s development?
Parents often assume that the play materials children choose are the ones that are best for their development.
•How will the toy help provide a foundation for my child’s future learning and development?
Some parents show their child books with pictures of fetuses, identifying those that are about the same age as the forthcoming sibling and discussing the baby’s development as it progresses.
Consider Carl, one of the most obstinate participants in a study of the combined impact that temperament and child rearing have on long-term development.
How can a parent identify the difference between a language disorder and normal language development?
If your child’s language development is delayed by several months when compared to norms for early language milestones, then your child might have a language disorder.
Because of wide individual differences, it’s sometimes hard to tell a language disorder from normal variation in language development.
Typically, children with hearing impairments are not identiﬁed until 12 to 25 months of age, when speech and language development is already delayed.
Newborn testing takes only a few minutes and permits problems to be addressed early, preventing negative consequences for all aspects of psychological development.
Most often, they consider delaying the start of school for boys, who as a group tend to lag behind girls in cognitive and social development.
Notice that each of the options just mentioned assumes that readiness is inherent in the child—that a 5-year-old must have reached a certain level of development to proﬁt from classroom experiences.
Consider, once again, the concept of the “zone,” in which teaching leads development.
65 Part of the reason for girls’ advantage in literacy development is that they undergo a faster rate of physical maturation, believed to promote slightly earlier development of the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex, where language functions are housed for most people.

The development of Chicano Muralismo grew out of the political context of the Chicano civil rights movement, a nationalistic political struggle waged by Chicanos during the 1960s.
The fullest development comes in Aristotle’s Politics and in the Nicomachean Ethics.
Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe give good grounds to think that much of the order in organisms, from the origin of life itself to the stunning order in the development of a newborn child from a fertilized egg, does not reflect selection alone.
The form of the aperiodicity will contain some kind of microscopic code that somehow controls the development of the organism.
Some vast network of regulatory interactions among genes and their products provides the mechanism that marshals the genome into the dance of development.
Clues that such a toolbox is experimentally feasible come from many recent developments, including the discovery that antibody molecules, evolved to bind molecular features called epitopes, can actually act as catalysts.
It was a profound insight in the development of equilibrium thermodynamics to recognize that the energy present in the thermal motions of an equilibrium gas system could not be extracted to do work.
An important step in “saving” the second law was taken by Leo Szilard, who also conceived of the nuclear chain reaction one day in London and helped set in motion the development of the atomic bomb and atomic energy.
It is the joint dynamical behavior of such genetic networks, plus the remaining cellular network of proteins and other molecular interactions, that controls cell behavior, including development from the fertilized egg to the adult.
I would note that such transient reversals happen all the time in normal development.
These cascades of alterations guide development and cell dierentiation.
We have spun out a biotechnology company, CIStem Molecular, that aims to clone the small cis acting DNA regions that control turning genes on and o in development and disease; a European daughter company, Euro-Bios; as well as EXA, a company spun out with NASDAQ to make tools for financial markets.

The United States must support such developments.
America's strategy should be a coalition strategy, that includes Muslim nations as partners in its development and implementation.
Economic development remains a distant hope.
He has embraced the Arab Human Development Report, which was highly critical of the Arab world's political, economic, and social failings and called for greater economic and political reform.
The policies that support economic development and reform also have political implications.
Recommendation: A comprehensive U.S. strategy to counter terrorism should include economic policies that encourage development, more open societies, and opportunities for people to improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects for their children's future.
The development of terrorist indicators has hardly begun, and behavioral cues remain important.
The solution, requiring more research and development, is likely to combine radio frequency technology with biometric identifiers.
The current patchwork of border screening systems, including several frequent traveler programs, should be consolidated with the USVISIT system to enable the development of an integrated system, which in turn can become part of the wider screening plan we suggest.
These laws required the development of strategic plans to describe how the new department and TSA would provide security for critical parts of the U.S. transportation sector.
Many of the act's provisions are relatively noncontroversial, updating America's surveillance laws to reflect technological developments in a digital age.
An unintended consequence of these developments has been the far greater demand made by Defense on technical systems, leaving the DCI less able to influence how these technical resources are allocated and used.
The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate.
One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development.
Recommendation: A specialized and integrated national security workforce should be established at the FBI consisting of agents, analysts, linguists, and surveillance specialists who are recruited, trained, rewarded, and retained to ensure the development of an institutional culture imbued with a deep expertise in intelligence and national security.

Social and Economic Malaise In the 1970s and early 1980s, an unprecedented flood of wealth led the then largely unmodernized oil states to attempt to shortcut decades of development.
By the late 1980s, diminishing oil revenues, the economic drain from many unprofitable development projects, and population growth made these entitlement programs unsustainable.
Unlike the oil states (or Afghanistan, where real economic development has barely begun), the other Arab nations and Pakistan once had seemed headed toward balanced modernization.
These developments further blocked the arteries of information sharing.
He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress.
Terrorists, in turn, have benefited from this same rapid development of communication technologies.
Two developments diminished this competition.
The second, related development was a significant transfer of planning and command responsibilities from the service chiefs and their staffs to the joint and unified commands outside of Washington, especially those for Strategic Forces and for four regions: Europe, the Pacific, the Center, and the South.
Clarke was only to "provide advice" regarding budgets and to "coordinate the development of interagency agreed guidelines" for action.
One especially noteworthy innovation was the creation of the Joint House-Senate Atomic Energy Committee, which is credited by many with the development of our nuclear deterrent capability and was also criticized for wielding too much power relative to the executive branch.
Noting that the plan was in a "very early stage of development," the NSC staff then told the CIA planners to go ahead and, among other things, start drafting any legal documents that might be required to authorize the covert action.
The original sealed indictment had added that al Qaeda had "reached an understanding with the government of Iraq that al Qaeda would not work against that government and that on particular projects, specifically including weapons development, al Qaeda would work cooperatively with the Government of Iraq."
In May and June, the U.S. government received a flurry of ominous reports, including more information about chemical weapons training or development at the Derunta camp and possible attempts to amass nuclear material at Herat.
Al Qaeda funded salaries for jihadists, training camps, airfields, vehicles, arms, and the development of training manuals.
The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements.
He did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11, other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system.
This suggests that the development of future guidelines should take YHL or other measures of quality of life into account.
Second, patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction were not eligible for enrollment because it was felt that statins would not influence the development of important prognostic determinants such as left ventricular systolic dysfunction, ventricular arrhythmias or mechanical complications [ 5 ] . Nevertheless, patients who develop electrocardiographic Q-waves represent a substantial proportion of all patients with myocardial infarction.
The issue of what to do about missing data caused by dropouts in clinical trials is a research topic that is still under development in statistical literature.
Meltrin α is expressed in vivo during development in condensed mesenchymal cells that give rise to skeletal muscle while meltrin β is expressed in craniofacial and dorsal root ganglia where neuronal lineages differentiate [ 26].
As both MMPs and COX-2 are important factors in tumor development [ 48, 49] IDO's role in tumorigenesis bears investigating.
NTPDases are important in many physiological processes like cell motility, adhesion, nonsynaptic information transfer, secretion, regulation of hemostasis and ectokinases [ 1 ] . Understanding the enzymatic mechanisms of the NTPDases will help description of their physiological functions, and development of strategies to regulate the functions of the enzymes.
Whole-genome expression profiling exemplified by the development of DNA microarrays represents a major advance in genome-wide functional analysis [ 1 2 ] . In a single assay, the transcriptional response of each gene to a change in cellular state can be measured, whether it is a viral infection, host cell cycle changes, chemical treatment, or genetic perturbation.
The observed disturbance of AMPA receptors may contribute to the neurotoxic process in other vulnerable brain regions and clinically to the development of dementia [ 35 ] . Interestingly, in a mouse model AMPA receptors in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum declined by 29-50% as early as 8 weeks post-retroviral inoculation.
Thus, the reduction in AMPA receptor density may contribute to the development of the cognitive abnormalities associated with HIV-1 infection [ 36 ] .
The action is mediated by specific nuclear receptor proteins, which belong to a superfamily of ligand-modulated transcription factors that regulate homeostasis, reproduction, development, and differentiation [ 87 ] . This family includes receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, hormonal forms of vitamin A and D, peroxisomal activators, and ecdysone [ 88 ] . Nuclear hormone receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate genes critical to such biological processes as development, reproduction, and homeostasis.

While structure-activity relationship studies and molecular modeling have led to the development of a detailed pharmacophore model, determining specific point interactions between 5-HT 3 antagonists and binding site amino acids has proven difficult.
Author 2 (JLC) contributed to the development of the experimental approach, helped analyze and interpret the data, and edited the manuscript.
They are structural and functional modulators of extracellular matrices that play important roles in CNS development and repair.
GAG-binding proteins can be differentially sensitive to variations in GAG structure [ 27 ] . GAGs produced among different cell types have structural and compositional differences and structural changes in GAGs are known to occur in cells undergoing morphological differentiation and/or malignant transformations [ 28 29 30 31 ] . Thus, in the native retina, or other tissue, modulation of the PEDF-receptor interactions may depend on the expression of GAGs, which occur during development and pathological conditions.
EMA participated in the design, assay development and carried out the complex-formation, GAG detection and receptor binding assays.
While the ultimate goal is the development of dynamic models for the complete simulation of cellular metabolism, the success of such approaches has been severely hampered by the lack of kinetic information on the dynamics and regulation of metabolism.
The rapid development of bioinformatic databases is resulting in extensive information about the molecular composition and function of several single cellular organisms.
These simulation experiments were iterated during the development of the approach.
In addition to stimulating the development of similar tools, CoreGenes will allow continuing improvements to it.
To date, transcriptomics is the most widely studied molecular approach, enabling researchers to examine subtle differences in thousands of mRNA levels between experimental samples, medical biopsies, etc . Although mRNA is not the end product of a gene, the transcription of a gene is both critical and highly regulated, thereby providing an ideal point of investigation [ 1 2 ] . Development of microarrays has permitted global measurement of gene expression at the transcript level and provided a glimpse into the coordinated control and interactions between genes.
The cDNA array has a long history of development [ 3 ] stemming from immunodiagnostic work in the 1980s; however, it has been most widely developed in recent years by Stanford University (California) researchers depositing cDNA tags onto glass slides, or chips, with precise robotic printers [ 4 ] . Labeled cDNA fragments are then hybridized to the tags on the chip, scanned, and differences in mRNA between samples identified and visualized using a variation of the red/green matrix originally introduced by Eisen and colleagues [ 5 ] . The light-generated oligonucleotide array, developed by Affymetrix, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA), involves synthesizing short 25-mer oligonucleotide probes directly onto a glass slide using photolithographic masks [ 6 7 ] . Sample processing includes the production of labeled cRNA, hybridization to a microarray, and quantification of the obtained signal after laser scanning.
The present article will take only the data from the liver as an example for the development of a gene selection model.
The following discussions describe the development of the model within the context of our nutritional study; however, a generic protocol can be found in the Materials and Methods section.
Measurement variance was examined following the development of the LFC model, and was therefore used simply as a confirmation of this model.
The conclusion that highly expressed genes will rarely have a 2-fold change in mRNA levels and that lowly expressed genes will commonly have a greater than 2-fold change led to the development of a model that would accommodate for this real biological characteristic of gene expression measurements.
In the data set that was used for illustrating the development of the LFC-model, duplicate measures were available for one of the four treatments.
MR initiated the development of robust mathematical techniques to evaluate microarray data at the Nestlé Research Center.
An equivalent presentation for intron conservation data is under development.
At this stage in our development of the sequence alignments, there are well-established and distinct patterns of sequence conservation and variation.
Thus, at this stage in the development of the alignments, the most conserved regions ( i.e., hour hand regions) and semi-conserved regions ( i.e., minute hand regions) have been aligned with high confidence.
The process of generating these secondary structure diagrams occurs in parallel with the development of the sequence alignments.
The development of a single chip containing the complete gene set for a given tissue or for a complex organism (30,000 to 60,000 genes) is likely in the near future, so it is paramount that chip manufacturers avoid these problems [ 7 ] . In this report, we demonstrate that microarray technology continues to be a dynamic and developing process and highlight potential pitfalls that must be addressed when interpreting data.
However, as demonstrated by our findings, the development of a standardized microarray system is needed to obtain more meaningful data from these experiments.
Affymetrix microarrays are used by many laboratories to study differences in gene expression associated with experimental treatments, diseases, development, aging, and other conditions.
Molecular methods, such as the evaluation of hormone receptors in breast carcinoma, have been effectively employed to further characterize tumors [ 1 ] . Nucleic acid array-based technologies extend molecular characterization by providing a biochemical snapshot, or profile, of cellular activity that encompasses thousands of gene products [ 2 ] . Potential applications beyond diagnosis and prognosis are diverse, and include treatment response stratification of patients in clinical trials, assessment of relevance to human safety of drug-associated tumors in animal carcinogenicity studies, and the development of more pertinent animal xenograft models of cancer therapy.
In higher eukaryotes, many genes feature differential spatial-temporal expression during development and throughout the life cycle of the organism.
As many genomic techniques are generating increasingly large amounts of molecular data, new tools such as this will be required for the synthesis of "parts into pathways" in order that we may understand how cells regulate the many processes necessary for growth and development.

In order to facilitate the development of sequence analysis applications based on the USM state space, the software library of functions written to calculate the USM coordinates is provided with the web-based implementation (see address above).
We next interchanged the test and training sets and used the same three rule development strategies.
The development of disease classifiers using routine analysis proved to be straightforward, and resulted in excellent performance in both the test and training sets (e.g.
In particular, if experimental bias and noise effects can be excluded, this region may prove to offer the optimum for ovarian cancer diagnostic test development.
As with all clinical test development, confirmation of results in independent laboratories running blinded samples will remain the gold standard in ruling out the possible effects of bias, unless the sample set itself contains the bias.
In the quest to determine Arabidopsis TF function and establish the regulatory networks that control the expression of all Arabidopsis genes, the development of a web-based resource that divides TFs into families and allows the rapid download of any Arabidopsis TF sequence and the fast identification of mutants, linked to the possible sequences to which these TFs may bind in the Arabidopsis genome is of pressing urgency.
Providing these resources and starting to link TFs to target genes is the basic motivation behind the development of AGRIS.
The web pages were developed using JavaServer Page (JSP) technology, because of its rapid development and easy maintainability qualities in development of dynamically-generated web pages and takes advantage of the java technology provided by the Apache Tomcat server http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat.
Overall, the collective effect of resveratrol would be to decrease endothelial injury and exposure of the subendothelial matrix, which would lessen the probability of formation of atherosclerotic plaques and the development of CHD [ 53, 54, 55].
Color development was achieved by incubating the membrane in substrate [(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-nitrobluetetra-zolium chloride) (BCIP-NBT)].
The anti-resorbing agent 17β-estradiol is especially noteworthy because of the association of its decline at menopause with the development of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Development of osteosclerosis and the disappearance of the marrow space in these estrogen-treated mice is an interesting and useful model since marrow stromal cells not only contain the precursors for osteogenic cell lineages, but they also exert important effects on osteoclastogenesis and lymphopoiesis, and modulate the effects of some systemic factors of bone turnover.
The ultrastructural alterations identified in estrogen-treated mice were very likely the cellular functional basis for the decreased resorption and development of osteosclerosis in estrogen-treated mice.
Future studies should also assess the temporal development of functional changes in the osteoclast populations during estrogen treatment, and the patterns of osteoclast death with special attention to apoptosis.
Girasole et al have recently shown that production of IL-6 is inhibited in vitro by exposure of marrow cells to 17β-estradiol; cultures of mouse bone cells showed suppressed osteoclast development when exposed to either 17β-estradiol or a neutralizing antibody to Il-6 [ 31].
Future in vivo studies combining estradiol and selected interleukins may further elucidate how the network of signals from the marrow microenvironment influences both Ocl development and Ocl function.
Shortly after injury, these small cytokines are primarily produced by fibroblasts, chemoattract leukocytes and activate their integrins causing them to adhere strongly to the endothelial cells as a prelude to their migration through the blood vessel wall to the underlying tissue and towards the source of the chemokine [ 5 ] . In addition to these functions during the early stages of wound healing, these small cytokines are also known to be involved in re-epithelialization, angiogenesis and granulation tissue development [ 3 6 7 8 ] , processes that are critical for proper healing.
The work presented here shows that cCAF, the IL-8 of chickens, stimulates expression of several ECM molecules important in development of the granulation tissue.
This is the first demonstration that treatment of wounds with a pro-inflammatory and angiogenic chemokine accelerates development of the granulation tissue during healing by stimulating the precocious deposition of ECM molecules that are critical for proper healing.
In the case of IP-10, it has been shown that in transgenic mice treated with this chemokine, wounds heal poorly and exhibit defects in angiogenesis and development of the granulation tissue [ 8 ] .
Our results strongly suggest that cCAF plays an important role in wound repair by activating fibroblasts to form early granulation tissue, through cell migration, myofibroblast differentiation and production/accumulation of ECM molecules that are critical for proper development of the healing tissue of wounds.
Transformation plates were incubated at either 23 or 30°C for 4-5 days and then stored at 4°C for one week to allow further development of the red color.
Myosin II, a key component of this actin-based cytoskeleton, has been shown to be essential for cytokinesis of D. discoideum cells in suspension as well as for efficient chemotaxis and morphogenetic changes in shape during development) [ 1 2 3 ] . All of these roles require myosin II to be in the form of thick filaments.
Previously we have examined the protein-protein interactions of proHB-EGF with the cell-surface CD9 antigen [ 9 ] . The CD9 antigen is found on a wide variety of tissue and cell types and has been reported to be involved in such cellular processes as B-cell development, cell metastasis, platelet activation and adhesion, and cell motility [ 14 15 ] . CD9 antigen is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily and consists of two extracellular domains sandwiched between four highly-conserved hydrophobic transmembrane domains [ 14 15 ] . The second extracellular domain (75-130 amino acids) is larger than the first extracellular domain (20-27 amino acids).
The interactions of LTBP-3 and fibulin-1C with the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF may provide further insights into the roles that these proteins play in cellular and tissue development processes.
In contrast, dark-grown seedlings undergo skotomorphogenesis (or etiolation), typified by elongated hypocotols and closed cotyledons [ 1 ] . COP1 was first identified through genetic screens as a negative regulator of light regulated development in Arabidopsis [ 2 ] . Arabidopsis cop1 mutant seedlings are constitutively photomorphogenic even when grown in the dark, and the severe cop1 mutants cause lethality in the late seedling stage, indicating that COP1 is essential for plant development [ 2 3 ] . Arabidopsis COP1 (Arabidopsis thaliana COP1, AtCOP1) is essential for the proteasome-dependent degradation of two transcription factors, HY5 and HYH [ 4 5 ] . These two homologous bZIP-type transcription factors directly interact with AtCOP1 and are capable of binding to light-responsive promoters to activate the transcription of many target genes [ 5 6 ] . Genome wide micro-array analysis shows that AtCOP1 regulates most, if not all, of the light-responsive genes under various light conditions [ 7 8 ] , substantiating the notion that AtCOP1 functions as a crucial developmental switch through targeting key transcription factors for degradation, thereby controlling the light-responsive gene expression and photomorphogenic development.

Studies of PP5 and its homologs in cultured cells and various organisms also suggest it may play a role in development [ 5 6 ] or during rapid cell growth [ 2 7 ] .
GABA signaling plays several roles in neuronal development.
Early in CNS development, GABA can modulate neuron progenitor proliferation as well as neuron migration, survival and differentiation [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].
Later, during postnatal development, normal GABAergic input is required for activity-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex as shown in the Gad2 knockout mouse [ 15, 16].
In addition to these functions in the developing CNS, GABA signaling is also required for the normal development of non-neural tissues.
Targeted mutations of the Gad1 gene lead to defective development of the secondary palate [ 17, 18].
The cleft palate phenotype of the Gad1 mutants suggests the involvement of GABA-mediated signals in the normal development and differentiation of a structure derived from the oral epithelium and neural crest ecto-mesenchyme.
This intriguing genetic evidence indicates a role for GABA-mediated signaling in the development of a non-neural structure, the secondary palate.
The potential for this pathway to be involved in the early development of additional non-neural tissues has not yet been thoroughly explored [ 23].
The earlier activation of Gad1 in the forelimb reflects the normal temporal order of events in limb development.
Expression was activated in a posterior to anterior (towards the nose) progression in the lateral nasal and maxillary rows, reflecting the pattern of vibrissal development [ 29].
The expression results reported here show that Gad1 was activated in several tissues outside of the central nervous system during mouse development.
As development proceeded Gad1 was detected in pharyngeal endoderm and in the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae.
During embryogenesis, post-transcriptional regulation occurs by alternative splicing during embryonic development in rats and mice [ 32, 33].
Previously reported sites of embryonic Gad1 expression outside of the brain and spinal cord during rodent development include the lens fibers and the olfactory pit [ 38, 39].
Our results document localized expression of Gad1 at additional non-CNS sites in the mouse embryo, suggesting a potential role for GABA signaling in the development of these structures.
The genetic data strongly suggest that GABA acts through GABA A receptors to modulate the development of this tissue.
The localized and dynamic expression pattern of Gad1 suggests a wider role for GAD and GABA in the development of non-neural tissues than was previously known.
In addition, mice lacking a single Hnf3 α allele have no observable phenotype, so that introduction of transgenes into this locus will not inherently affect embryonic development [ 14, 15].
5 days of embryonic development.
Aggregates that formed blastocysts after overnight culture were allowed to continue their development in utero by transferring them to a pseudopregnant surrogate mother.
Recent developments in the understanding of the role of mesenchymal cells and their products in regulation of proliferation and differentiation of tissue cells were initiated more than seventy years ago, when Alexis Carrel demonstrated that leukocyte extracts, like embryonic tissue extracts, stimulate multiplication of fibroblasts in vitro, and suggested that leukocytes can bring growth- activating substances to tissue-specific cells [ 11].
The relationship of mesenchymal and epithelial cells appears to be tissue-specific and established during the critical period of development, which coincides with the end of the immune adaptation [ 9].
The extent to which epithelial cells are stimulated to differentiate by mesenchymal cells is dependent on the extent to which the particular tissue differentiates during the critical period of development [ 9].
Epigenetic programing of the "stop effect" appears to depend on the extent of differentiation of tissue cells during critical period of development, such as termination of the immune adaptation.
When bovine somatic cells were transferred into preactivated recipient oocytes, the resulting reconstructed embryo development was limited, since all embryos arrested at the 8-cell stage regardless of the cell cycle of the donor cells [ 14].
Development of Reconstructed Embryos
This phenomenon is considered to involve nuclear structural changes, such as nuclear envelope breakdown, premature chromosome condensation and pronuclear development and swelling [ 27, 28, 29].
Therefore, our results clearly indicate that porcine M I oocytes like M II oocytes have the ability to reprogram confluent somatic cell nuclei as determined by nuclear remodeling and in vitro development.
It is known that pronuclear exchange between zygotes does not prevent development of the reconstructed embryos [ 39] but transfer of donor nuclei from later developmental stages into enucleated zygotes brings about restricted development [ 40, 41].
It is known that pronuclear exchange between zygotes does not prevent development of the reconstructed embryos [ 39] but transfer of donor nuclei from later developmental stages into enucleated zygotes brings about restricted development [ 40, 41].
It is possible that optimization of methods for activation improves the development of embryos reconstituted with M I oocytes.
Development of Reconstructed Embryos
Similar demonstrations performed in other insects [ 6], leeches [ 7], nematodes [ 8], ascidians [ 9], and zebrafish neural crest [ 10] indicate that lateral inhibition operates in diverse developmental contexts throughout metazoan development.
To investigate further the role of Notch-mediated cell-cell signaling in vertebrate neural development we have tested neural pattern formation in zebrafish embryos.
We examined the RNA expression patterns of delta and notch genes using a sensitive fluorescent detection method, choosing as our timepoint 24 h (hours of development at 28.
Together, these observations suggest that a subset of neural precursors and cells specified for neuronal development express dlA , dlB and dlD .
isl1 -positive cells from notochord and floorplate, presumed sources of signals that induce motor neuron development [ 47].
Although we do not know the normal fates of the cells that replaced ablated primary motor neurons, these observations are consistent with the possibility that, during normal development, primary motor neurons inhibit neighboring cells from adopting a primary motor neuron fate.
To further test the role of Delta-Notch mediated lateral inhibition in zebrafish neurogenesis, we examined embryos homozygous for a missense mutation of dlA ( dlA dx2 ). We previously described the effect of this mutation on development of floorplate, notochord and hypochord [ 37] and dorsal spinal sensory neurons and neural crest [ 38].
This indicates that disruption of Delta-Notch signaling causes development of excess primary motor neurons, which have identities appropriate for their positions in the neural tube.
This indicates that, in flies, precursors express Delta and that those specified for neuroblast development downregulate its expression.
Genetic analyses of fly development then led to the view that lateral inhibition is mediated by interaction of Delta and Notch proteins expressed on neighboring cells [ 12].
Following color development, the embryos were treated with 2 N NaOH for 1 hr, washed with PBSTx (phosphate buffered saline with 0.01% TritonX-100), blocked 1 hr in PBDTx (PBS, 1% DMSO, 0.01% TritonX-100 plus 2% sheep serum and 2 mg/ml BSA, then incubated 2 hr with anti-BrdU (monoclonal G3G4, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank).
This requires the integration of transcriptomic, proteomic, phenomic, and bioinformatic approaches, not least because development, in its most basic sense, is genes plus context [ 19 20 21 22 ] .
This modified expression of genes and proteins associated with the inhibition of the cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis, as well as the increased activation of proapoptotic and compensatory antiapoptotic pathways, provides a "snapshot" of the broad primary and secondary effects of NF-κB signaling during SMG development.
2 arrest, as well as apoptosis via p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways [ 50 51 52 ] . The presence of a dysplastic SMG phenotype in E2f1 -/-mice indicates that E2F1 plays an important role during SMG development [ 53 ] . Moreover, E2F1 overexpression in human salivary gland (HSG) cells diverted these cells into an apoptotic pathway [ 54 ] .
However, others have shown that lower doses ≤ 100 μg/ml of SN50 specifically inhibited NF-κB nuclear translocation in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and murine T cells [ 33 63 ] . These reported differences are likely due to dose-dependent or cell-specific differences in the effect of SN50 [ 64 ] . Given that: (1) embryonic SMGs were cultured in the presence of 100 μg/ml SN50, (2) immunodetectable NF-κB was absent from SMG epithelia nuclei in TNF + SN50-treated explants, and (3) one cannot extrapolate observations in Jurkat cells to those in primary cells [ 64 ] or organ cultures, it is most probable that our observed interruption of SMG development is proximately due exclusively to the inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation.
It is essential for animal development, immune system function, and wound repair.
These animals are transparent and anatomically simple, so cell migrations can be followed in the living animal at all stages of development by fluorescence microscopy of GFP fusion proteins or by Nomarski microscopy.
Later in development, mec-17 also contributes to the maintenance of mec-3 expression [ 16].
Abnormal anterior segment development is often associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), an important risk factor for the blinding disease glaucoma [ 1].
The molecular mechanisms responsible for normal or abnormal development of the iridocorneal angle, its structures, and increased resistance to aqueous drainage in glaucoma are not well defined.
Cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation are important for the development of this ocular region.
As TM development proceeds the cellular mass differentiates, organizes and develops channels to produce the mature meshwork.
Some of these theories propose atrophy or resorption of the mesenchyme as development progresses to create the structures and spaces important for aqueous drainage while others propose a reorganization of cells with no cell death or atrophy.
Whether cell death or atrophy occurs during TM and iridocorneal angle development remains controversial.
The mouse represents an important experimental model for understanding mammalian development and diseases caused by its abnormalities.
In studied mammalian species, iridocorneal angle development is incomplete at birth.
Although various studies have characterized in detail the prenatal development of the mouse eye there is very little published about the normal structure or postnatal development of the mouse iridocorneal angle [ 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].
Although various studies have characterized in detail the prenatal development of the mouse eye there is very little published about the normal structure or postnatal development of the mouse iridocorneal angle [ 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].
We present a light and electron microscopic (EM) evaluation of iridocorneal angle development in staged embryos and through eight postnatal weeks, when the angle structures have reached full maturity.
Prenatal development
This study of the prenatal development of the C57BL/6J iridocorneal angle, essentially agrees with published reports of general ocular development for the strains CFI-S [ 24] and Ha/1CR [ 22].
This study of the prenatal development of the C57BL/6J iridocorneal angle, essentially agrees with published reports of general ocular development for the strains CFI-S [ 24] and Ha/1CR [ 22].
Postnatal development
To further understand iridocorneal angle development, we analyzed stages involving significant changes in the TM and SC using EM.
Absence of cell death in angle development
It is probable that all normal cell death during development utilizes pathways of programmed cell death (PCD) [ 28].
As a final assessment of a role for cell death pathways, we determined whether absence of the FAS and FASL initiators of cell death alter iridocorneal angle development and morphology.
This indicates that these pro-apoptotic molecules are not required for normal iridocorneal angle development.
Our findings extend those of previous studies that did not focus on the iridocorneal angle or did not study its development to maturity [ 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].
Although there is evidence for a role of most of these processes in iridocorneal angle development and intertrabecular space opening (see [ 17]), the role of cell death or atrophy is controversial.
Macrophages also can elicit cell death in normal development (see [ 32]).
Macrophages were reported in the developing mouse (B6) anterior chamber and a model of TM development including cell death was proposed, but no cell death was recorded [ 26].
No evidence for cell death during mouse angle development
Finally, development of the angle in Fas and Fasl null mice was normal indicating this system of cell death regulators that can kill TM cells [ 30] is not required for TM channel formation.
Based on these observations, we conclude that neither apoptosis nor necrosis are important mechanisms in development of the mouse TM and iridocorneal angle.
Thus, we suggest that the macrophages previously reported in TM of mice (and possibly some other species) were involved in the process of pupillary membrane regression and were sometimes deposited in the TM but were not significant for TM development.
The demonstration of cell death in a SD strain of rats has fueled the debate about mechanisms of iridocorneal angle development [ 18].
Given the similarities in developmental stages between both B6 and A.BY/SnJ mouse strains and humans, and the similar timing and progression of angle development in mice and rats, it seems unlikely that mechanisms of angle morphogenesis would differ between mice and rats.
Our results support a model of mesenchymal differentiation and iridocorneal angle development that involves reorganization of cellular and extracellular matrix components without cell death or atrophy.
For general anterior segment development, this is supported by the observations that genetic deficiency of transcription factors such as PAX6, PITX2, FOXC1 [ 44, 45], and LMX1B that are expressed in the periocular mesenchyme results in anterior segment dysgenesis in both humans and mice [ 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54].
This is partly due to limited documentation of the sequence of events underlying iridocorneal angle development and limited documentation of the mature angle structures in mice.
The current study provides important baseline information for mechanistic studies of angle development in the existing mouse models of anterior segment dysgenesis.
Additionally, it will facilitate experiments with mutant mice to determine how newly identified genes function in angle development and how the pathways in which they participate overlap or interact with each other.
To determine if absence of the cell death mediators FAS and FASL alter iridocorneal angle development and morphology, we assessed five mice (approximately P70) of each of the mutant strains B6.MRL- Fas lpr and B6Smn.C3H- Fasl gld , which respectively lack functional FAS and FASL [ 55, 56, 57, 58].
Iridocorneal angle development is somewhat variable both temporally and spatially within a single eye and between eyes.
Similar Cre reporter strains have been produced using different promoters to express lacZ [ [ 6 7 8 9 ] ], Another variation on this theme has been the development of the Z/AP reporter strain, which switches from lacZ to alkaline phosphatase expression upon exposure to Cre recombinase activity [ 10].
Furthermore, by using modified forms of Cre whose recombinase activity is inducible, one can use these reporter mice to perform detailed analysis on the lineage of cells at different time points during development.
Embryological literature includes a broad array of descriptions of development in one organism or another.
A monophyletic ancestry for the vertebrates, with the possible exception of cyclostomes, implies that some common inherited mechanistic themes exist for development.
Development in many of the approximately fifty orders of fishes remains unknown.
Their adult anatomy and distribution have been used to construct phylogenies for actinopterygian evolution, and details of their embryonic development are likely to have similar usefulness.
Most previous work on the early embryonic development of
Much of the description of early embryonic development in the garpike is based on material that was badly distorted by harsh fixation procedures.
Recent embryological study of the garpike either has been restricted to the development of specific structures in older embryos, e.g. [ 10], or has been reported in sketchy fashion ancillary to studies with another purpose, e.g. [ 11].
We took a fresh look at this animal to describe in familiar terms the sequence of events during its development.
Studies of those groups [ 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] illustrated the marked differences in development among them.
For example, development of the sturgeon is relatively frog-like and the bowfin is much more similar to teleosts in its gastrulation pattern.
We found that garpike development differs from that of the basal fish listed above, as well as teleosts.
We list short-term rates for early stages of development, at several temperatures, in the following paragraphs.
Development for this batch was not timed past six days because travel arrangements precluded it.
3A, 3B, 3C) - This stage begins the blastula phase of garpike development.
Development of the adhesive organ produces a bean-shaped swelling anterior to the brain.
Study of their development is an appropriate sequel to previous work on members of the Chondrostei - the paddlefish, Polyodon [ 12] and the sturgeons.
The teleost ysl has important mechanical and communications functions in early development [ 19, 20, 21].
Garpike embryos, however, possess combinations of features whose investigation should prove valuable in the areas of development, evolution and taxonomy.
Furthermore, identification of ESTs derived from mouse and human embryonic cDNA libraries along with our Northern data on mouse embryo RNA indicate that mNoc is expressed early in development.
In the latter experiments the effects of proteolysis and its inhibition on the development of the olfactory nerve itself were tested using axonal, glial and neuronal outgrowth markers.
Unilateral insertion of PB coated beads into the olfactory placode of stage 17 embryos did not disrupt the development of either axonal or glial components of the olfactory nerve between stages 18-21 (Table 3).
As the length of each developmental stage varies [ 22 ] , it is difficult to determine precisely the amount of time by which biochemical development of the axons is accelerated.
Implantation of trypsin coated beads at stage 17 had no effect on either the timing of nerve development (axonal or glial) or the biochemical differentiation of the axons.
The use of these beads is an established method widely utilized to deliver exogenous proteins during development.
For example, in their study of limb development, Fallon et al.
The basis for the development of this planar or tissue polarity has principally been studied in Drosophila [ 1 2 3 4 ] where it is under the control of the frizzled ( fz ) pathway [ 5 ] . Many Drosophila epidermal cells produce cuticular hairs that are outgrowths from the apical surface of pupal epidermal cells.
The development of epidermal hairs has principally been studied on the wing where each pupal cell produces a single distally pointing hair.
To determine if the fz pathway played a role in arista development we examined the aristae of various fz pathway mutants [ 1 5 ] . We found that multiple wing hairs ( mwh ), which results in an average of almost 4 hairs per cell on the wing also resulted in the formation of multipled and branched laterals.
The altered location for lateral initiation in fz and other mutants was similar to their phenotype in the wing [ 5 ] . Prior to hair initiation in wing cells Fz, Dsh, Fmi and Dgo accumulate on the distal side of wing cells (Stan and Dgo are also thought to accumulate on the proximal side) [ 9 10 11 12 13 ] . To see if this could be the case for lateral development we examined the distribution of Fz in developing arista using a Fz-GFP encoding transgene gene.
We next attempted to determine the critical time for in function in lateral development using temperature shift experiments with the temperature sensitive allele in II53 [ 20 ] . On the wing this allele results in a large phenotypic difference when pupae grown at the restrictive versus permissive temperatures.
Lateral growth takes place over more than 18 hours at 29°C and more than 30 hours at 18°C giving us a wide window for shift experiments [ 8 ] . In shift experiments we found that the crucial time for in function in lateral development was around the time of lateral initiation (26 hours at 29°C and 52 hrs at 18°C) (Fig.
We compared the multipled lateral phenotypes of in and fy single mutants and fy; in double mutants and found no difference consistent with in and fy functioning in the same process in lateral development (Table 1).
When we examined the development of fz mutant laterals by phalloidin staining we found that lateral initiation was not as restricted to the distal part of cells as is the case in wild type (Fig.
The distal accumulation of Fz-GFP could be detected until late in lateral development.
It was reported previously that Fmi/Stan protein accumulated to a higher level in the PI cell that forms the bristle lineage [ 22 ] . Previous experiments have shown that Fz regulates orientation of the spindle in the division of the PI cell of the bristle sense organ lineage and it has been thought that this is the way that fz regulated bristle polarity [ 4 6 ] . Our observations suggest that fz may also play a later role in specifying bristle polarity that is analogous to its role in regulating hair and lateral development.
In this way wild type laterals resemble fz mutant wing cells [ 5 ] . Thus, early in their development laterals are not close to the junctional complex or the prominent cortical cytoskeleton at the cell periphery and are unlikely to be getting any orientation guidance in this way.
It is also worth considering that the elongated shape of the lateral forming cells becomes much more extreme as development proceeds (Fig 4) [ 8 ] . This brings the laterals close to the cell edges that are parallel to the proximal distal axis of the central core and the junctional complexes at these edges could provide orientation guidance.
Previous studies on in and fy function in regulating wing hair development have focused on their role in regulating the site for hair initiation [ 5 20 ] . Observations reported in this paper show that multiple laterals associated with in and fy mutants can arise either from independent initiation events or from the splitting of an elongating lateral.
These shift experiments showed that the essential time for in function in lateral development is around the time of lateral initiation.
This is similar to what we previously found for in function in wing hair development [ 20 ] . It is interesting that the consequences of a lack of in function in laterals are manifested some hours after the end of the in temperature sensitive period.
Previous observations had indicated that the fz pathway functioned in the development of planar polarity in hairs, bristles and ommatidia [ 5 6 7 14 ] . Consistent with much current thinking on signal transduction pathways it has been suggested that there is a core group of fz pathway of genes that function similarly in different cell types [ 2 ] . Downstream genes would function to interpret the signal from the core group of genes in a cell type specific way.
In this paper we provide evidence that a modified version of the frizzled pathway regulates the development of arista laterals.
After observation water was removed from the slides and the pupae were then kept in a humid chamber at 25°C for further development and observations.
Of the factors that contribute to specifying cell fate during development, Wnt proteins are among the most attractive candidates to use in such in vitro experiments.
Wnt proteins control numerous aspects of development, ranging from stem cell control to differentiation and cell polarity [ 1 2 ] . It has been problematic however to test directly whether Wnt proteins can be used as reagents in cell culture, because working with soluble Wnt proteins is difficult and few cell lines are known to respond to Wnt proteins.
The overall pattern of gene expression observed in response to Wnt has important implications for the role of Wnt signaling in development and cancer.
Mis-regulation of Wnt signaling leads to the development of several human cancers, including colon carcinomas and melanoma [ 1 ] . Canonical Wnt signaling initiates in the binding of a Wnt ligand to its cell surface receptor, members of the frizzled gene family, along with the co-receptor LRP5/6 [ 2 3 ] , leading to changes in the activities of cytoplasmic effectors resulting in the stabilization of beta-catenin protein.
SL-1 is a matrix metalloproteinase that can alter ECM-mediated signaling events during development [ 29 30 31 ] . Both SL-1 and Wnt-5a have roles in mammary gland development and are elevated in certain breast cancers [ 32 33 34 35 ] , although Wnt-5a is reduced in other types of breast cancer [ 36 ] .

The initiating events of development of Dictyostelium include sensing starvation and cell density, which in turn result in the dispersed cells acquiring the ability to aggregate.
The mechanism of sensing the density of starved cells insures that aggregation occurs only when there are sufficient numbers of starved cells to form aggregates and subsequent structures of appropriate size for optimized spore dispersal [ 2 3 4 ] . Hence, starvation and a threshold of cell density are the two known prerequisites for the transition from growth to development.
Conditioned medium factor (CMF) is a 80 kDa glycoprotein that is essential for early development [ 3 4 10 ] . CMF is sequestered in vegetative cells and is secreted upon starvation [ 4 ] . A critical concentration of extracellular CMF is required for subsequent development as CMF is involved in regulating aggregation, cAMP pulsing, and early developmental events [ 2 3 11 ] .

Although recent investigations have revealed several components involved in regulating the initiation of development [ 15 16 17 18 ] , little or no information exists on how the cells sense starvation and in particular amino acid deprivation.
Early studies indicated that depletion of amino acids and not other nutrients is essential for initiation of development [ 19 20 21 ] . Upon amino acid starvation, among other events there is a substantial decrease in the rate of initiation of protein synthesis, resulting in a reduction in size and amount of polysomes and accumulation of free ribosomes [ 19 22 23 ] . It is believed that the decrease in protein synthesis in response to starvation occurs post-transcriptionally, since adding back amino acids rapidly restores protein synthesis and does not require new mRNA synthesis [ 22 ] .
We reasoned that a GCN2-like protein might be involved in sensing amino acid starvation in Dictyostelium and in regulating the growth to development transition.
The findings presented herein indicate that neither of the ifk genes is involved in initiating development.
However disruption of the ifkA gene resulted in several defects during the first few hours of development.
The increased phosphorylation by IfkA normally occurs from 1 to 7 hours after the onset of development, resulting in a secondary shift from polysomes to free ribosomes for bulk mRNA.
Expression of ifkAand ifkBmRNA during growth and development
RNA was isolated from the parental or "wild type" strain (Ax4) and the ifkA null strain (BS153, described below) during growth and at various times after the onset of development.
2represents the additive mRNA levels from both genes in Ax4 during growth and development, while panel B reflects ifkB mRNA levels and panel C reflects ifkA mRNA levels.
IfkB mRNA expression remains constant as development proceeds, while the levels of ifkA mRNA dramatically drop soon after the onset of development and remain at a low level for the remainder of development.
IfkB mRNA expression remains constant as development proceeds, while the levels of ifkA mRNA dramatically drop soon after the onset of development and remain at a low level for the remainder of development.
IfkB mRNA expression remains constant as development proceeds, while the levels of ifkA mRNA dramatically drop soon after the onset of development and remain at a low level for the remainder of development.
Some of the results below, including the morphology during development, were confirmed in the other, independently isolated null strains.
BS153 and Ax4 cells were grown on bacteria and plated under standard conditions of development after removal of the bacteria.
BS153 cells were able to develop and form fruiting bodies, indicating that if IfkA is involved in sensing amino acid starvation to initiate development this involvement is nonessential.
However, development of BS153 cells was atypical in several ways.
BS153 cells formed ripples, the first visual sign of aggregation, as early as 4 hours, and the tight mound stage was attained by 7 to 8 hours after the onset of development.
Development of the cells in monolayers in buffer or in conditioned medium from BS153 or Ax4 cells [ 10 ] indicated that secreted factors were involved in causing both the earlier aggregation of BS153 cells and the larger size of the resulting multicellular entities.
One secreted factor that is involved in regulating aggregation, cAMP pulsing, and early developmental events is CMF [ 2 3 ] . CMF mRNA levels were normal in BS153 during growth and development (not shown).
The cAMP cell surface receptor Car1 ( carA gene) is responsible for sensing secreted cAMP and activating adenylyl cyclase ( acaA gene), which in turn results in the production and secretion of cAMP in order to relay the cAMP pulses [ 38 ] . Normally both of these genes are expressed at very low levels in growing cells, and their expression is induced during the first few hours of development, including a stimulation of expression by the cAMP pulses themselves [ 39 ] .
RT-PCR was carried out on RNA isolated from growing cells and at various times after the onset of development of BS153 and Ax4 cells (fig.
In the Ax4 parental strain, there was a basal level of phosphorylation of eIF2α found in growing cells, and the level was higher from 2 to 6 hours after the onset of development (fig.
In contrast, eIF2α phosphorylation in BS153 cells remained at the basal, growth specific level throughout the times of development that were examined (the first 10 hours).
In Dictyostelium , a major shift in the polysome profile occurs as a result of starvation and initiation of development [ 19 23 ] . The percentage of mRNA associated with polysomes drops from about 80-90% in growing cells to 50-60% within several minutes of removal of the food source.
However, at two hours and four hours after the onset of development evidence was found for a second, smaller magnitude polysome shift.
Although the initial decrease in translation is a result of a different mechanism, we conclude that phosphorylation of eIF2α by IfkA from about 1 to 7 hours after the onset of development results in a further decrease in overall translation initiation and thus in a secondary shift of polysomes to free ribosomes.
In the parental strain Ax4, the level of countin mRNA gradually decreased with time after the onset of development (fig.
To examine this possibility, the distribution of countin mRNA within the polysome profiles of Ax4 and BS153 were examined before and after the onset of development.
The results indicate that in the absence of IfkA and its phosphorylation of eIF2α during early development, countin mRNA is retained less well on polysomes and has fewer associated ribosomes.
This suggests that normally during early development in the wild type strain, enhanced translation of countin mRNA occurs as a result of IfkA phosphorylating eIF2α.
Also, it is possible that reduced association with ribosomes results in a destabilization of countin mRNA, and this might account for the more rapid loss and lower levels of countin mRNA found in BS153 cells after the onset of development.
To examine this possibility, countin mRNA levels were examined after the inhibition of transcription, 2 hours after the onset of development, using actinomycin D [ 40 ] . After inhibition of transcription, countin mRNA was lost earlier in developing BS153 cells than in the parental Ax4 cells (fig.
Recent findings indicate the presence of another Countin-like factor, Countin2, that is involved in regulating aggregate size [ 14 ] . Countin2 mRNA levels were found to be the same in BS153 and Ax4 during growth and development (not shown).
Depletion of amino acids as opposed to other nutrients such as glucose and vitamins was shown to be responsible for shutting down growth and cell division and initiating the developmental program [ 19 20 21 ] . Although substantial progress on the regulation of the initiation of development in Dictyostelium has been made [ 15 16 17 18 ] , how the cells sense starvation and in particular amino acid deprivation is unknown.
GCN2 of yeast and mammals is a known sensor of amino acid starvation and regulates cellular responses to such starvation [ 24 25 ] . Using degenerate primers and PCR and database searching identified two GCN2-like genes in Dictyostelium , ifkA and ifkB . Thinking that one or both of these genes may play a role in sensing amino acid starvation and in initiating development, we carried out the work described herein to examine their functions.
Although it is possible that IfkB plays a role in the transition from growth to development, we do not think it does.
A basal level of eIF2α phosphorylation was found in growing cells, and this basal level was maintained during development in the ifkA null strain.
Instead, only a basal and unchanging level of phosphorylation during growth and development can be attributed to IfkB.
A very early event marking the initiation of development is a substantial reduction in overall translation initiation and a concomitant major shift of ribosomes from mRNA-associated ribosomes (polysomes) to free ribosomes [ 22 23 ] . The percentage of mRNA associated with polysomes drops from about 80-90% in growing cells to 50-60% within several minutes of the removal of the food source.
Disruption of the ifkA gene was accomplished, and several defects were found in the null strain (BS153) that indicted a role for IfkA and eIF2α phosphorylation during the first several hours of development.
Examining the morphology of the null strain revealed two major aberrations relative to the normal morphology attained during development.
In addition, these genes are "pulse-induced" genes and thus their induction during early development normally is enhanced and promoted as the cAMP pulses are established [ 39 ] . The early and more abundant induction of their mRNAs in BS153 indicate that the pulsing system is functioning earlier in the absence of IfkA.
Examination of eIF2α phosphorylation in ifkA null cells indicated that the IfkA protein is responsible for increased phosphorylation eIF2α from 1 to 7 hours after the onset of development.
The uORFs are involved mechanistically in bringing about enhanced translation initiation under conditions that otherwise favor a general decrease in translation initiation [ 25 ] . Within the 5' UTR of countin mRNA, we find uORFs similar in number and in arrangement to those of GCN4 mRNA, the major mRNA regulated by yeast GCN2 [ 25 ] . Thus, we suggest that countin mRNA, and probably other as yet identified mRNAs, are translationally upregulated when IfkA phosphorylates eIF2α during the preaggregation period, or from 1 to 7 hours after the onset of development.
Indeed we found less intracellular Countin throughout the first 8 hours after the onset of development of BS153 cells.
In addition, there was significantly less Countin secreted during the first 8 hours of development.
The heterogeneity of the size of the aggregates of developing BS153 might arise from the fact that extracellular countin levels eventually reach near normal levels, at about 10 to 12 hours after the onset of development.
Since the extracellular concentrations of Countin reflect cell density, perhaps it is important to maintain a constant level of Countin production and secretion once development has been initiated.
In summary, the findings suggest that IfkA is an eIF2α kinase of Dictyostelium that normally phosphorylates eIF2α from 1 to 7 hours after the onset of development, or during the preaggregation phase.
Cell growth and development
Cells were grown axenically in HL5 media or on SM plates with Klebsiella pneumoniae [ 45 ] . Cells grown in the presence of bacteria were using for development as described [ 46 47 ] unless otherwise stated.
For determination of the extent of eIF2α phosphorylation, Ax4 and BS153 cells were plated for development, and samples were taken at various times.
ifkA null cells and Ax4 cells after starvation, mid-log phase cells growing axenically were collected, washed, and resuspended in the standard development buffer (PDF, 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.1, 5 mM magnesium chloride, 0.5% streptomycin sulfate) at 5 × 10 6cells/ml.
RNA was isolated, processed, and used for RT-PCR as described [ 51 52 ] . For polysome analysis, BS153 and Ax4 cells were harvest from bacterial growth plates before noticeable presence of Dictyostelium cell growth . After removal of bacteria, cells were plated for development as described above.
After 2 and 4 hours of development, cells were collected into polysome buffer (HMK-NP40 plus cycloheximide to stabilize the polysomes).
For all RNA samples used in RT-PCR reactions, H7 specific oligonucleotides were used as a control; H7 mRNA is expressed at a constant level during growth and development [ 47 ] and thus monitors relative levels of RNA used in the reactions.
Homeobox genes of the Hox class are required for proper patterning of skeletal elements [ 7 ] . The functional role of Hox genes in skeletal growth and development has been clearly demonstrated, but how they control the differentiation of specific tissues is not well understood.
The structural rigidity of rib cartilage is greatly compromised, fatally interfering with pulmonary function, and vertebral cartilage is so weak that the skeleton often disassembles during skeletal preparation [ 1 ] . These results suggest that Hoxc-8 continues to regulate skeletal development well beyond pattern formation in a tissue-specific manner, presumably by controlling the progression of cells along the chondrocyte differentiation pathway.
Detailed knowledge of regulatory mechanisms in endochondral ossification will be essential for strategies to manipulate chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation and maturation in skeletal growth and development, osteochondrodysplasias and fracture healing.
A similar phenotype is found in Hoxd-4 transgenic mice ( [ 1 ] and Kappen, manuscript in preparation) indicating that Hox transcription factors regulate chondrocyte development.
While additional measurements at later stages of development would be needed to confirm whether this is a continuous trend for cartilage development in late pregnancy in Hoxc-8 overexpressing animals, these results were initially unexpected: The phenotype of Hoxc-8 transgenic animals at 17.
While additional measurements at later stages of development would be needed to confirm whether this is a continuous trend for cartilage development in late pregnancy in Hoxc-8 overexpressing animals, these results were initially unexpected: The phenotype of Hoxc-8 transgenic animals at 17.
As shown in Figure 8, Hoxc-8 expression is elevated in Hoxc-8 transgenic mice, as expected [ 23 ] . Differences also exist between controls and transgenics in expression levels for several genes involved in cartilage development.
Staining of sections for BrdU incorporation was done using the Zymed BrdU staining kit with Horseradish Peroxidase, and development with DAB for 5 minutes.
Diapause is generally characterized by a slowing of metabolism, a reduction or elimination of cell division and a cessation of morphological development, evident as a 'resting stage' [ 1 ] . Diapause occurs in response to stimuli that predict adverse environmental conditions, not in response to the conditions themselves.
Once in diapause, development is not resumed even if conditions return to those amenable to growth.
Until recently diapause was generally considered a physiological phenomenon, and much research had concerned the conditions that induce diapause and the endocrinology of its regulation [ 2 3 ] . Nevertheless, diapause is also a developmental process, and these previous studies did not address fundamental questions concerning development before, during and after diapause.
More recent research has begun to focus on the molecular aspects of diapause, with studies of Bombyx morii , Sarcophaga crassipalis , and Lymantria dispar identifying genes up- and down-regulated during diapause [ 1 4 5 6 7 ] . In order to complete this picture, however, detailed descriptions of the morphological aspects of development spanning diapause are also necessary.
The total period of egg development is reported as approximately 100 days [ 8 ] . In contrast, parthenogenetic embryogenesis is completed in approximately 10 days.
Certain aspects of aphid egg development have been elucidated in other species.
The conditions required to induce the production of sexual males and females has been established [ 8 9 ] . There has also been work on the influence of genetic background and the environment on the duration of egg development in different species and strains [ 10 11 ] . The most comprehensive study of aphid egg development, by Behrandt [ 12 ] , suggests that it constitutes three stages: (i) a temperature dependent period of initial development, (ii) a temperature independent 'diapause' followed by (iii) temperature dependent development.

The most comprehensive study of aphid egg development, by Behrandt [ 12 ] , suggests that it constitutes three stages: (i) a temperature dependent period of initial development, (ii) a temperature independent 'diapause' followed by (iii) temperature dependent development.

Additionally, development is only completed successfully if the eggs are chilled for at least a short period of time during early development.
Additionally, development is only completed successfully if the eggs are chilled for at least a short period of time during early development.
Here we present a description of the development of sexually-produced pea aphid embryos.
We maintained embryos under conditions that mimic those experienced naturally (0-4°C), and tracked their development through sampling and dissection.
In aphids, and most other insects, however, there is a strong relationship between temperature and developmental rate [ 19 ] . In order, therefore, to determine whether any resting stage we observed at 0-4°C was truly diapause and not a consequence of low rearing temperatures, we also tracked the development of embryos maintained under warmer conditions (10°C and 16°C).
Further, to determine whether there was a cessation of cell division at any point during development, we immunostained the embryos with anti-Histone H3, which identifies cells undergoing mitosis.
Finally, we tested whether putatively diapausing embryos could resume development and hatch earlier than the reported 100 days [ 8 ] by transferring embryos from 0-4°C to 16°C at day 49 and tracking their development.
Finally, we tested whether putatively diapausing embryos could resume development and hatch earlier than the reported 100 days [ 8 ] by transferring embryos from 0-4°C to 16°C at day 49 and tracking their development.
We show that under winter-like conditions, development is continuous but slow, and progresses in a temperature independent manner for part of the time.
The data indicate that A. pisum undergoes a type of diapause, but one that is different from the 'cessation of development' presented as diapause in many other insects.
Embryonic development at 0-4°C
The first 15 days of development at 16°C of a sexually produced A. pisum embryo has been described previously by Miura et al.
Figure 3shows the changes in length of the body and third leg from day 21 to completion of development for all three temperature regimes.
Figure 2illustrates the development of an embryo maintained at 4°C days and 0°C nights from day 15 - 85.
Embryonic development at 10°C
Embryonic development at 10°C suggests that early development of the sexually-produced A. pisum embryo, particularly before katatrepsis, is temperature independent.
Embryonic development at 10°C suggests that early development of the sexually-produced A. pisum embryo, particularly before katatrepsis, is temperature independent.
Late development of the sexually-produced A. pisum embryo, particularly during and after katatrepsis, appeared to be temperature dependent.
Development was completed by day 77 at 10°C in contrast to day 100 at 0-4°C.
Embryonic development at 16°C
Embryonic development at 16°C again suggests that early development of the sexually-produced A. pisum embryo is temperature independent.
Embryonic development at 16°C again suggests that early development of the sexually-produced A. pisum embryo is temperature independent.
Typically the embryos showed accelerated development of part but not all of their morphology.
None of the embryos maintained at 16°C either completed development or hatched.
Embryonic development after transfer from 0-4°C to 16°C
Transferring aphids from 0-4°C to 16°C on day 49 resulted in almost immediate katatrepsis followed by a rapid completion of development (figure 7).
This is in contrast to asexually-produced embryos where growth rate approximately doubles between 5°C and 10°C and between 10°C and 16°C [ 19 ] . In sexually-produced embryos the period of temperature independent development, or diapause, ends around katatrepsis.
After this point development becomes temperature dependent, with more rapid growth at 10°C than at 0-4°C.
At all the temperatures tested there was no cessation of morphological development.
This appears to be somewhat contrary to the traditional understanding of diapause, which typically involves a distinct 'resting stage' [ 1 21 ] . Much research has revealed, however, that even during the 'resting stage' there are physiological changes in the diapausing insect, leading to the concept of 'diapause development' [ 22 23 ] . Nevertheless, such development appears to be primarily physiological rather than morphological, and was defined as physiogenesis by Andrewartha (1952).

It is possible that the morphological development observed in diapausing A. pisum is exceptional.
Alternatively, diapause in many other insects may also involve a slowing but not a cessation of morphological development.
There are, however, a few examples of continued morphological development during diapause.
Diapausing embryos of the orthopteran Austroicetes cruciata undergo slow development for the first two months of diapause, before entering a resting stage [ 24 ] . Similarly, caterpillars of Cirphus unipunctata and Laphygma exigua continue to feed and develop during diapause, albeit at a much-reduced rate [ 25 ] , and caterpillars of the corn-stalk borer Sesamia nonagriodes undergo non-stationary moults during diapause [ 26 ] . These examples hint that the expression of diapause-controlled dormancy may vary between species [ 2 ] . Consequently, diapause could be considered extreme regulation of developmental rate, rather than a shutting down of morphological development.
The mechanisms that control diapause in A. pisum may therefore be the same as those that control the rate of morphological development at other stages of development.
The mechanisms that control diapause in A. pisum may therefore be the same as those that control the rate of morphological development at other stages of development.
In embryos that remained at 0-4°C until day 98, there was no obvious difference in development rate during and after diapause, and this is consistent with observations in other insects [ 1 27 ] . There must, however, be some change in condition to move development from being temperature independent to temperature dependent [ 1 ] . This change appears to be at or around katatrepsis.

Identifying what this change is, and what, if anything, it has to do with katatrepsis, will be key to understanding how the pea aphid controls development during diapause.
The genetic pathways involved in the development of A. pisum embryos must build an animal under two conditions.
The first is slow, temperature independent development at low ambient temperatures in sexually-produced embryos, and the second is rapid temperature dependent development at higher ambient temperatures in asexually-produced embryos.
The first is slow, temperature independent development at low ambient temperatures in sexually-produced embryos, and the second is rapid temperature dependent development at higher ambient temperatures in asexually-produced embryos.
Presumably the same pathways are involved in both processes - it would be surprising if A. pisum were to have different sets of genes for the two modes of development.
Diapause may therefore act to limit the speed of reactions that would otherwise occur more rapidly at higher temperatures, possibly through the action of an 'inhibitory factor' [ 22 33 ] . According to this model, the higher the ambient temperature the greater the required activity of the inhibitory factor [ 33 ] . When temperatures are maintained at abnormally high temperatures (16°C), regulation may be compromised with only some aspects of development slowed.
The one system where diapause has been well elucidated, dauer formation in the nematode C. elegans , indicates that the insulin pathway plays an important role [ 34 ] . Recent work on mutant Drosophila that mimic reproductive diapause in adults also suggests a role for insulin [ 35 36 ] . Insulin, which regulates growth in other stages of development in Drosophila [ 37 38 ] , may therefore play a similar role during A. pisum diapause.
Since heat-shock proteins are also involved in cell cycle arrest, however, they may play a more central role in the regulation of diapause [ 1 ] . Heat-shock proteins are also typically heat inducible, and so fit with the concept of a temperature dependent 'inhibitory factor' [ 33 ] . Additionally, high levels of heat-shock proteins may disrupt development [ 41 ] , which could help explain the developmental defects observed in embryos maintained at 16°C.
If this interaction term is significantly different from zero it indicates that the slope of the relationship between length and age (rate of development) varies with temperature.
Our aim is not to criticise these theoretical developments at all.
Of course, capturing the essence of complicated behaviour using simple models is an important step in theory development, and it is easy to challenge such models by pointing out elements or complications that are missing.
Author 2 (PS) aided the theoretical development.
Defining which factors affect flowering is important for a better understanding of plant growth and development and offers an opportunity to study the interactions of environmental cues, chemical signals, and gene expression.
Many plant species, including maize and other grasses are much less dependent on the photoperiod and gibberellin than Arabidopsis, suggesting that different signals may be required for flower development.
Plant height and development
One hypothesis that can be tested is the involvement of phenylpropanoid intermediates as signaling molecules in plant development.
While comparisons between a wild type and a mutant that has been subjected to six or seven backcrosses are generally considered acceptable, there is still a small risk of linkage drag, creating the possibility that genes linked to the brown midrib genes are affecting the development.
Preliminary allelism tests indicated there are at least three different bmr loci [ 25 ] . The bmr mutants that were part of this study did not show any major abnormalities in their growth and development.
, nematodes) with a false coelom and finally to the bulk of animal phyla having a true coelom (Coelomata) [ 1 2 ] . There has never been complete agreement on animal phylogeny and classification, but most researchers have divided living coelomate animals into deuterostomes (echinoderms, hemichordates, urochordates, cephalochordates, and vertebrates) and protostomes (arthropods, annelids, mollusks, and other phyla) based on differences in early embryonic development.
Experimental studies of invertebrates that contain only a single Runx gene (sea urchin, tunicate, and nematode) are therefore likely to highlight primitive (general) functions of this family of transcription factors in the control of cell fate, proliferation, and differentiation during metazoan development.
, segmentation in arthropods [ 15 ] , bone development in vertebrates [ 20 ] , etc.).
Thus, studies of Runx genes in sea urchins, tunicates, and nematodes are likely to highlight primitive, pan-bilaterian regulatory functions of this family of genes in the cell biology of animal development.
As a consequence, mouse models are useful for identifying and characterizing the effects of causative genes necessary for glaucoma development, and for characterizing the genes and molecular pathways that participate in or modify disease progression [ 9].
We have documented the development of a disease involving iris stromal atrophy and glaucoma in aged AKXD28 mice.
These genes include PITX2, PITX3, PAX6, FOXC1 (previously known as FKHL7 and FREAC3), Foxc2 and FOXE3 [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 ] . Activity levels for these transcription factors normally associated with diploid gene dosage are important for normal ocular development, with heterozygosity for null mutations in most of these genes causing anterior segment dysgenesis.
For FOXC1 and PAX6, both haploinsufficiency and increased gene dosage due to gene duplication result in abnormal ocular development [ 10 11 12 13 ] . Similarly, a mutation in PITX2 that results in increased transcriptional transactivation causes ASD [ 14 ] .
Although originally named because of their ability to induce bone and cartilage formation [ 15 ] , BMPs are involved in many developmental processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, and intercellular interactions during morphogenesis [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ] . Members of the bone morphogenetic protein family function in a gene dosage dependent manner during development and participate in ocular development [ 26 27 28 29 ] . Therefore, mutations that alter the level of BMPs or alter the degree of BMP signaling are candidates to contribute to Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and other conditions involving anterior segment malformation, elevated IOP, and glaucoma.

Bmp4 is expressed in multiple tissues during embryonic development, including the heart, lung, kidney, brain, and eye [ 19 24 ] . In the eye, Bmp4 expression is first identified in the distal optic vesicle and overlying surface ectoderm at the 8-12 somite stage and later in the dorsal portion of the developing optic cup [ 31 ] . Lens induction is absent in homozygous Bmp4 mutants and can be rescued by exogenous BMP4 protein [ 31 ] .
The effects of decreasing Bmp4 dosage on anterior and posterior segment development have not been reported.
Abnormalities of the iridocorneal angle included small or absent Schlemm's canal (SC), hypoplastic or absent trabecular meshwork (TM) that appeared compressed and stalled in development, and iris attachments to the peripheral cornea (synechiae.
To investigate the consequences of functionally halving Bmp4 gene dosage on iridocorneal angle development in more detail, we used transmission electron microscopy.
The abnormalities affect a variety of anterior segment tissues including the drainage structures of the iridocorneal angle and are similar to those reported in human patients with ASD and glaucoma [ 36 37 38 ] . The absence of detectable Bmp4 expression in the drainage structures suggests that BMP4 produced by the ciliary body and/or iris may act as a growth and differentiation factor during angle development.
Bmp4affects retinal vascular development and hyaloid vascular involution
Vertebrate retinal development is an intricate process involving complex pathways that are not completely understood [ 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 ] . Although our cell marker analysis indicates that all major retinal cell types differentiate, haploinsufficiency of BMP4 results in a variety of retinal abnormalities.
Retinal dysplasia is characterized by palisading outer retinal cells that surround a central lumen [ 57 ] . It occurs in mice with a variety of genetic defects and in some instances is associated with abnormalities of the retinal pigment epithelium [ 58 59 60 61 62 ] . Both during development and in adult life, the retinal pigment epithelium is critical to retinal function [ 63 ] . BMP2 and 4 may act as negative growth regulators in the retinal pigment epithelium [ 64 ] . It is possible that haploinsufficiency of BMP4 in the retinal pigment epithelium may be responsible for focal retinal dysplasia and displacement of photoreceptor nuclei.
Wild-type levels of BMP4 are important for normal development of the anterior and posterior segments.
These mice provide a model to study these diseases and various processes of ocular development.
Development of the YAC map was described previously by Engle, et al.
In this population, insulin resistance is a major risk factor for the development of the disease [ 2], and maximal insulin action (i.e.
Because NIDDM is a genetic disorder [ 10] and results from an imbalance between insulin sensitivity and beta cell function, we hypothesized that the A54T polymorphism of the FABP2 gene plays a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, which is one of the key determinants for the development of NIDDM [ 2].
Furthermore, since 1) insulin resistance is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of T2DM, 2) this polymorphism has only a very modest influence on insulin sensitivity, and 3) beta cell dysfunction, on which this polymorphism has no influence in the present study, plays a key role in the development of overt diabetes [ 2], the population association studies and linkage studies are not able to detect the interaction between this polymorphism and the diabetes phenotype.

Macronuclear development
An analogous sequence, E-cbs, has been characterized in Euplotes by sequence comparisons and analyses of DNA intermediates and products of MAC development [ 37 38 39 ] . At a fixed distance from itself, E-cbs directs a 6-nucleotide staggered cut, with a protruding 3'OH to which telomerase adds telomere repeats.
A variety of 5'-3' exoncleases are known in eukaryotes (review: [ 68 ] ), so it is reasonable to assume such an activity operates during macronuclear development.
Evidence suggests that gain of function in PAX7 triggers neoplastic development by maintaining cells in a deregulated, undifferentiated and proliferative state, as is seen in alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas.
Thus far, this phenotype segregates as an autosomal recessive trait and maps to the FEOM2 locus on chromosome 11q13 [ 8 ] , and affected individuals carry homozygous mutations in ARIX [ 5 ] . ARIX encodes a homeodomain transcription factor required for nIII and nIV development in mice and zebrafish [ 22 23 ] . In families with CFEOM3, the CFEOM phenotype is variably expressed.
ARIX, which encodes a transcription factor critical to nIII and nIV development in mice and zebrafish [ 22 23 ] , was recently identified as the FEOM2 gene mutated in affected members of CFEOM2 families [ 5 ] . It was unknown, however, if classic CFEOM may also result from mutations in this gene.
This finding is consistent with our prediction that, compared to ARIX, the genes mutated in CFEOM1 may have a more restricted function in the development of nIII and that their expression may actually be regulated by ARIX.
This study revealed absence of the superior division of the oculomotor nerve and the corresponding central caudal and medial nIII subnuclei, and marked abnormalities of the levator palpebrae superioris and superior rectus muscles [ 4 ] . These findings suggest that while ARIX is necessary for both nIII and nIV development, the CFEOM1 genes may be necessary for the development of only these two specific nIII subnuclei.

Once identified, we anticipate that the study of the function of these genes will contribute to our understanding of midbrain motor neuron development.
This suggests that MYOC haploinsufficiency is not causative for glaucoma and that myocilin may even be dispensable or redundant in normal human development or only important when ocular stress occurs.
The presence of a single hs-E2F transgene gave a weak and incompletely penetrant enhancement in the absence of heat shock, and this enhancement was stronger and completely penetrant when the transgenic strain was exposed to a heat shock treatment every 24 h during third instar and early pupal development (fig.
What is the function of each of these kinesins in plant growth and development?
The expression of both Dazl1 and Dazap1 persisted throughout testes development, in both the prenatal and postnatal periods.
The expression of DAZAP1 during germ cell development paralleled that of DAZL (Figure 5).
Nucleoplasmin is the most abundant protein in the Xenopus oocyte nucleus and is the protein for which the term molecular chaperone was coined due to its multiple roles in the assembly of nucleosomes during early frog development [ 1 ] . Nucleoplasmin forms a pentamer and its stretches of acidic residues bind to histone H2A and H2B.
The development of distinct tissue and cell types is a fundamental characteristic of growth in higher organisms.
In particular, the identities of five Antennapedia -like homeobox genes have been disclosed from both our and the Spanish asexual strains [ 11 26 ] . These findings imply that PEVE may affect other asexual strains of planaria, thus paving the way for the development of transgenic planaria using the planarian viral sequences as vectors for introduction of exogenous DNA into planarian cells.
Among the 30,000 - 40,000 human genes [ 1 2 ] , an expanding list of genes has been shown to be involved in cancer development and progression.
First, cancers are often detected at a late stage in development, after multiple genetic and epigenetic changes have rendered the cancer metastatic and highly refractory even to harsh treatment.
The development of high throughput genomic technologies enables us to screen thousands of genes simultaneously for the informative genes, yet the power of these technologies is greatly attenuated when inappropriate samples are studied.
This observation motivates the development of experimental protocols that allow application of genomic technologies to minute amounts of biological materials.
Concomitant with this development of asymmetrical structure, the AAA1 protomer of the dynein motor unit evolved a functional dominance, in which it alone retains the full ability for binding and hydrolysis of ATP, while AAA2, AAA3 and AAA4 have lost the capability for hydrolysis and the most degenerate protomers AAA5 and AAA6 show no significant binding of ATP [ 20 21 22 ] . In midasin, the specialization of AAA protomers appears to have taken a less drastic course than in dynein.
[ 22 ] showed that SCYA17 potentially played a role via a paracrine mechanism in the development of allergic respiratory diseases.
TrkA plays a crucial role in the development and function of the nociceptive reception system.
The use of high-density microarray technology to identify specific genes that are expressed differently under one or more biological conditions is particularly relevant to drug discovery and development.
Deletion of the 13q region is associated with human 13q syndrome, a developmental disorder [ 24 ] . Some of the proteoglycans play important functional roles in neurogenesis, axon guidance, synapse development [ 25 ] , and cellular growth and differentiation [ 26 27 23 ] . Mutations in GPC3 cause Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome [ 28 29 ] , however, no mutations were detected in the GPC5 and GPC6 genes [ 30 ] . The glypican1 gene has been suggested to be a good candidate for brachydactyly type E [ 31 ] . Given that, GPC5 is highly expressed in brain and mutations in other genes of the glypican families are associated with developmental disorder; GPC5 could be a potential candidate gene for Bipolar disorder.
SLC participated in the development of ~15 Mb map region on human chromosome 13q32.
These include, but are by no means limited to, (i) comparisons of healthy and diseased tissue in order to understand malfunctions in regulation and identify genes essential for control, thus identifying target molecules for the development of novel therapeutics and (ii) the observation of changes in expression over time after addition of a drug to elucidate the mechanism of action of pharmaceuticals and predict their toxicology.
Improvements in sequencing automation and analysis such as capillary electrophoresis have speeded up the process considerably and recent developments such as a sequencing method based on real-time pyrophosphate [ 16 ] , sequencing on microchips [ 17 ] , and massive parallel signature sequencing on microbead arrays [ 18 ] also contribute to the speed and depth of EST gene expression analysis.
For example, TOX may also be involved in germinal center B lymphocyte development and/or function [ 16 ] .
Several other HMG-box proteins also play important roles in lymphocyte development [ 17 ] . Mice doubly deficient in lymphocyte enhancement factor-1 (LEF-1) and T cell factor-1 (TCF-1) have a complete block in development of T cells [ 18 19 ] , while deficiency of SRY-box containing protein 4 (SOX-4) in mice results in a lack of pro-B cell expansion and mild perturbation of thymocyte development [ 20 ] . Unlike these HMG-box proteins, however, we find that the HMG-box of TOX is more closely related to the DNA binding domain of sequence-independent HMG-box proteins.

The history of the T locus began with the discovery in 1927 of a semi-dominant mutation in mice, named Brachyury , or T for tail, that affects both embryonic viability in homozygotes and tail development in heterozygotes [ 1 ] . This original T allele represents a deletion spanning 160-200 kb (reviewed in [ 2 ] ), the developmental effects of which have been well characterized [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 ] . Homozygous mutant embryos show a developmental failure of the notochord and posterior mesoderm, and die at midgestation.
That observation led to the development of a system for investigating the expansion of trinucleotide repeats in yeast in which the promoter is combined with the URA3 gene, a widely used counter-selectable marker [ 19 23 ] . In our work, we took advantage of the specific spacing requirements of the ADH1 promoter to develop a novel TAR cloning procedure that allows isolation of genomic regions that lack ARS elements.
A prerequisite for development of the system was an estimate of the minimal size of targeting hooks required for TAR cloning.
The mutagens permit direct selection of clones in which cellular genes have been disrupted and simplify the characterisation of genes associated with recessive mutations [ 1 ] . Mutagenesis of embryo-derived stem (ES) cells, coupled with in vitro genetic screens, has been widely used to analyse gene functions in mice [ 1 ] . These have included screens for mutations in developmentally regulated genes [ 2 3 4 5 ] , in genes regulated by extracellular agonists [ 6 7 ] , and in genes encoding secreted and transmembrane proteins [ 8 9 ] . Characterized mutations include genes involved in intracellular trafficking [ 10 ] , transcriptional regulation [ 11 12 ] , signal transduction [ 7 8 11 13 14 15 ] , neural development [ 16 ] and neural wiring [ 17 ] , and axial patterning [ 18 19 ] . The rapid expansion of the nucleic acid databases has had a tremendous impact on the identification of genes disrupted by gene entrapment.
This has led to the development of tagged sequence mutagenesis, a process by which genes disrupted in ES cells are characterized at the nucleotide level prior to germline transmission [ 20 21 22 23 24 ] .
These have included the sequencing of randomly selected cDNAs from various tissue sources, the development of computer-based prediction programs of ever-increasing accuracy, and the direct comparison between the human genome and the genome sequences of other vertebrates and invertebrates [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ] . Using these approaches, fully annotated genomes of numerous species will be available within a relatively short time.
For example, the study of hamster gametes has revealed significant information concerning the mechanisms underlying species-specific sperm-egg interactions [ 11 12 13 ] and the deleterious effects of endocrine disruptors on male and female reproductive development [ 14 15 16 17 ] . The hamster, mouse and rat are all members of the family Muridae, however both mice and rats belong to the subfamily Murinae while hamsters belong to the subfamily Cricetinae.
A recent gene discovery study performed in the testis of Drosophila melanogaster found that 47% of greater than 1500 sequenced cDNAs did not match to ESTs previously identified in this organism [ 19 ] . Likewise the testis of the cynomolgus monkey has yielded several novel gene sequences [ 8 9 ] . Therefore, we reasoned that the sequencing of ESTs from hamster testis might reveal the existence of novel genes conserved in other species that may function in controlling testicular development and/or function.
The grain-filling process of cereal development typically has two processes: dilatory and filling.
In this manner we have identified several genes potentially involved in grain filling, and evaluate them by comparison with grain filling genes identified in an earlier study [ 1 ] . These genes have similar expression profiles showing significant differential expression during rice grain development and tissue specificity to panicle and grain.
The decomposition of a matrix of expression levels, A , presented us with several interesting patterns for gene expression during grain development (Figure 1).
Given these differences, both methods agree on a majority of grain filling genes, which had very significant differential expression during grain development.
The right singular vectors that match our preconception of a grain filling pattern of expression, for example, low expression during panicle development and increasing expression during grain development, were identified after A was decomposed.
While analysts have predicted that very high polymorphism densities will be required for association mapping in mixed or outbred populations [see for example reference [ 7 ] ], promising results have been obtained using genome scans of 600-1200 STRPs in isolated populations where levels of linkage disequilibrium are particularly high [ 8 9 10 ] . In this manuscript we describe the development of two new 10 cM human STRP Screening Sets (Sets 12 and 52) which when combined provide average STRP spacing of 4.8 cM.
Development of human STRP Screening Sets has paralleled advances in construction of genetic and physical maps.
The development of Screening Sets 12 and 52 will improve gene mapping in general, and specifically genome scans where a relatively high STRP density is required.
NFAT4/x has been implicated in development of immature thymocytes [ 5].
In addition, mice deficient for Btk and PLCγ2 have similar defects in B cell development and function (reviewed in [ 30]).
The Btk mutations found in XLA patients and the xid mouse show that Btk is required for normal B cell development, but the important pathways activated by Btk have yet to be fully identified.
Development of the parallel plate flow chamber that simulates the conditions of physiologic flow has been an important tool for dissecting the molecular events occurring between flowing leukocytes and endothelium [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 ] .
This is particularly relevant to T Lymphocytes because of their ability to recognize antigen only if this is associated with the class I or the class II MHC molecules [ 3 ] , and also because of the unique selection process which operates within the thymus during T cell development.
Early during T-cell development in the thymic cortex, thymocytes bear both of the T cell surface glycoproteins CD4 and CD8 and express the α and β heterodimer of the TCR [ 4 ] . Compelling data have demonstrated that CD4 and CD8 molecules participate in the selection of MHC class I or class II restricted T cells in the thymus.
An accepted scheme of the T cell development program [ 29 30 ] has demonstrated that as immature cells enter the thymus, cycling CD4 -CD8 -precursors begin to rearrange δ, and γ genes, which generates CD4 -CD8 -, and δ +γ +cells.
In addition, a distant relative Schnurri ( Shn ) has been identified in Drosophila [ 18 19 20 ] . Although little is known about the physiological functions of the mammalian ZAS proteins, Shn has been shown to be an important transcription regulator during embryonic development.
Thymocyte development occurs within a complex network of cells, extracellular matrix, and secreted factors referred to as the thymic microenvironment [ 1 ] . Current evidence suggests that this microenvironment is created during fetal thymus organogenesis through stage-dependent interactions between differentiating thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and developing thymocytes [ 2 3 4 5 6 ] . Therefore, blocks at different stages of thymocyte development result in differential effects on TEC differentiation and function.

Therefore, blocks at different stages of thymocyte development result in differential effects on TEC differentiation and function.
Because of the complex interdependence of TEC and thymocyte differentiation, defects in fetal TEC development can be caused either directly by cell-autonomous TEC differentiation defects, or indirectly by defective thymocyte maturation.
Cytokines produced by TECs have been shown to promote proliferation in early stages of thymocyte development, and have been proposed to regulate apoptosis and differentiation, although their precise roles remain controversial [ 23 24 ] . TECs have also been shown to promote thymocyte proliferation in SP cells after selection has occurred [ 15 ] . However, a defined role for TECs at the TN-DP transition remains elusive.
In order to investigate the regulation of thymocyte development by TECs, we are studying Hoxa3 +/- Pax1 -/-compound mutant mice.
Hoxa3 and Pax1 are transcription factors that act in a common pathway regulating thymus organogenesis and thymic epithelial cell development [ 29 31 32 33 34 ] . Hoxa3 +/- Pax1 -/-compound mutants have defects in TEC development including reduced numbers of TECs, fewer MHC Class II +TECs, and changes in TEC proliferation and apoptosis.

Hoxa3 +/- Pax1 -/-compound mutants have defects in TEC development including reduced numbers of TECs, fewer MHC Class II +TECs, and changes in TEC proliferation and apoptosis.
We compared fetal and adult wild type mice with Hoxa3,Pax1 compound mutants [ 29 34 ] . We also assayed Rag1 -/-mice, which have defects in TEC development due to arrested thymocyte maturation at the TN3 stage [ 35 ] . We found stage-specific differences in proliferation levels between fetal and adult wild type thymocytes.
To test whether the changes in cytokine levels were responsible for the observed thymocyte development phenotypes, we attempted to rescue these phenotypes by supplementation in fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC).
Cultures from control genotypes (wild type, Pax1 +/-, Hoxa3 +/-, Pax1 -/-) behaved as expected [ 41 42 43 44 45 46 ] , with addition of IL-7 causing an increase in the percentage of DN cells and a corresponding decrease in DP cells, while adding SCF had no significant effect on thymocyte development (data not shown).
Abnormal TEC development in both of these mutant strains resulted in both increases and decreases in thymocyte proliferation in a stage-specific manner, rather than simply an overall reduced ability to promote proliferation.
There is considerable evidence that thymopoiesis differs in the fetal thymus during the initial creation of the microenvironment, as opposed to adult thymus function (reviewed in [ 47 ] ). Differences have been reported in responses to some cytokines, in signaling at the TN-DP transition in fetal compared to adult thymus, and in proliferation of CD4 +SP thymocytes [ 36 48 49 50 ] . The proliferation profiles of both wild type and Rag -/-fetal thymocytes support the hypothesis that fetal thymocyte maturation is fundamentally different from thymocyte development in the adult thymus.
reported 2-10 fold reductions at every stage of thymocyte development in Rag -/-adults [ 13 ] . Recent work by Petrie, et al.
Rag -/-mutants have a profound thymocyte development block at the TN3 to TN4/preDP transition [ 51 ] . During normal wild type fetal thymus development, significant DP cell development does not occur until E16.

5 the thymic microenvironment in Rag mutants has not been exposed to abnormal thymocyte development for very long, and has not yet developed the full phenotype seen in the steady state adult Rag mutant thymus [ 35 ] .
For example, SCF and IL-7 have been shown to have synergistic functions [ 62 63 ] . Therefore, changes in multiple cytokines in Hoxa3 +/- Pax1 -/-mutants would be expected to have complex effects on thymocyte development that could be difficult to predict.
A striking example is the complete absence of γδTCR +thymocyte development in IL-7 mutants, in contrast to normal γδTCR +cell development in Hoxa3 +/- Pax1 -/-mutants [ 29 ] , which have dramatically reduced IL-7 levels.
A striking example is the complete absence of γδTCR +thymocyte development in IL-7 mutants, in contrast to normal γδTCR +cell development in Hoxa3 +/- Pax1 -/-mutants [ 29 ] , which have dramatically reduced IL-7 levels.
This result suggests that although γδTCR +cell development requires IL-7, low levels are sufficient for this function.
Therefore, analysis of mutants with low levels of cytokines may provide a system for uncovering both dosage-dependent requirements and later functions for these factors in promoting thymocyte development.
Studies of IL-7R mutants showed relatively normal thymocyte maturation at fetal stages, albeit with reduced thymocyte numbers, in contrast to a severe block in thymocyte differentiation in adult thymus [ 49 ] . Analysis of cytokine mutants during fetal stages could therefore reveal a more complete picture of the role of these cytokines during fetal thymus development.
Taken together, our results further define the role TECs play at this complex stage of thymocyte development.
Some of the earliest changes that occur following BCR engagement are the activation of several non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), including p55 blk (Blk), p59 fyn (Fyn) and p53/56 lyn (Lyn) of the Src family [ 31 ] , Btk of the Itk/Tec family [ 32 33 ] and p72 Syk (Syk) of the Syk/ZAP-70 family [ 34 ] . The importance of Syk in BCR signaling and lymphocyte development has been clearly demonstrated using gene inactivation approaches.
Although syk -deficient mice die perinatally, analysis of radiation chimeras reconstituted with fetal liver from syk -deficient mice has demonstrated a block in the transition from proB cells to preB cells, indicating that signal transduction through Syk is required for early B cell development [ 35 36 ] . Inactivation of the syk gene in the chicken DT40 B cell lymphoma leads to a loss in the activation of PLCγ2, the increase in intracellular free Ca 2+and the apoptotic response following engagement of the BCR.
JWH participated in the design of the studies described and in the initial development of the BCL 1 .3B3 system.
The skewed pattern of thymocyte development toward CD4 +single positive in each of the lines was similar to that observed in DO11.
Because the expression of hCARΔcyt was detected early in thymocyte development (Fig.
The proliferative responses and potential for Th1 and Th2 phenotype development were therefore examined following adenoviral transduction.
Transduced, sorted GFP +and GFP -CD4 T cells were cultured under Th1-/Th2-polarizing conditions and examined for cytokine production following re-stimulation to determine potential effects of adenoviral transduction on effector phenotype development (Figure 4B).
Thus, neither hCAR expression nor adenoviral transduction alters the naïve T cell's potential for Th1 or Th2 phenotype development.
Importantly, the expression of hCARΔcyt by T cells was stable and high-level at all stages of development, from double-negative thymocytes to Th1 and Th2 effectors.
An important consideration at the outset of these studies concerned the possibility that ectopic hCAR expression or adenoviral transduction might affect the normal development and/or function of T cells.
For this reason, we chose to use a truncated variant of hCAR to preclude possible signaling by this molecule [ 13 ] . As evidenced by the functional data reported herein, and those from previous reports [ 14 15 ] , there does not appear to be an adverse effect of either hCARΔcyt expression or adenoviral transduction on T cell activation, development or function.
Further, continued advances in the development of "gutless" adenoviral vectors that avoid expression of cytotoxic antigenic targets may alleviate immune clearance problems [ 22 23 24 ] .
The development of newer recombinant adenoviruses containing elements for epichromosomal replication may alleviate limitations that prevent more stable in vivo expression in dividing lymphoid cells derived from hCAR transgenic mice.
It may be that the various lymphokine growth factors are differentially produced at different time points during the ontogeny of the immune system at different stages in the development of an immune response or at different sites within the body or lymphoid tissues [ 30 ] . Our studies have confirmed the importance of multiple cytokine stimulation of lymphocytes and how NK cells are crucial to the development of spontaneous cytotoxicity and are the major contributors to LAK activity in vitro when U-937 cells were used as targets.

T1DM susceptibility in the NOD mouse is linked to I-A g7, the murine MHC class II gene that encodes a histidine at position 56 and a serine at position 57 in the β chain, in place of the more frequent proline 56β and aspartic acid 57β [ 3 ] . The development of diabetes is prevented in NOD.PD mice (which are NOD mice with I-A g7) that carry a β chain transgene with site-specific mutations that restore proline and aspartic acid at positions 56β and 57β, respectively [ 4 ] . Furthermore, because of the two amino acid changes in the additional (transgenic) MHC class II allele β chain in NOD.PD mice, NOD.PD mice recognize three additional peptide epitopes in the glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) autoantigen [ 5 ] .
However, it was initially unclear whether anaphylactic reactivity also could be elicited to self peptides that have been implicated in the development of a spontaneous autoimmune disorder.
In the present study, we show that anti-peptide autoantibodies and fatal anaphylactic reactions can be elicited by immunodominant GAD65 peptides in NOD mice that have been injected with these peptides intraperitoneally in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), as part of an attempt to induce "tolerance" and prevent the spontaneous development of T1DM.
Thus, in both the EAE model [ 14 ] and the NOD T1DM model (this study, and that of Liu et al ., [ 15 ] ) some form of artificial "immunization" with a self peptide preparation appears to be required for the development of anaphylactic reactivity to "self".
Whatever the underlying reason(s) for the development of anaphylactic reactivity to these self peptide preparations, in both the EAE and the NOD T1DM models, anaphylactic reactions occurred in mice that had developed strong IgG1 responses to the relevant self peptides, with only modest changes in total IgE levels.
Taken together, these findings suggest that IgG1 antibodies contribute importantly to the development of anaphylaxis in both of these models.
Although HIV infection elicits neutralizing antibodies and a cellular immune response against the virus [reviewed in [ 1 ] & [ 2 ] ] and there exist "exposed uninfected" (EU) individuals that appear to have acquired resistance to infection by HIV [ 3 4 ] , the hallmark of HIV infection is the almost universal inability of humans to mount an immune response that can prevent the eventual development of AIDS.
Critical epitopes may be masked by glycosyl groups and/or tertiary structure [ 13 14 15 ] and [ 16 ] The extensive genetic variability of HIV complicates immunogen choice and the high rate of mutation increases the likelihood of the rapid development of resistance.
These cross reacting antibodies actually promote viral uptake by macrophages [ 21 22 ] . The main challenge in using live dengue in humans is thus avoiding the development of antibody dependent enhancement(ADE) of infection by antibodies against the pre-M and E proteins of one dengue strain which weakly cross react with the pre-M and E of a second infecting dengue strain.
[ 29 ] . Similarly, mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing authentic NS1 [ 30 ] were protected against the development of dengue-4 virus encephalitis when challenged by intracerebral injection.
Although our successful development of a plasmid which can express a dengue replicon from transfected DNA facilitates delivery by DNA vaccination [ 12 ] , the development of packaging cell lines which can package these replicons into virions would be a major step forward towards a vaccine which could be conveniently administered in typical clinical situations.

Based on these findings, and the presence of a Cet1 homolog in the Apergillus fumigatus proteome, we conclude that RNA triphosphatase is a valid target for antifungal drug development.
The technique of mRNA differential display has been used to detect differences in gene expression between different types of cells [ 18, 19], during cell transformation [ 20, 21], and in various stages of disease development [ 22].
Development of P. cariniiinfections in rats and preparation of P. cariniiinoculum
After development of P. carinii infection (approximately six weeks after inoculation), rats were sacrificed, and lungs were removed and homogenized in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, New York) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% non-essential amino acids.
Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G; Pierce) was used to visualize proteins by development with nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (NBT-BCIP; Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ).
Macrophages were infected with M. paratuberculosis at a 5:1 ratio and fixed in glutaraldehyde at various time points to examine the development of mycobacteria in this environment (Fig.
observed that patients with AIDS or AIDS-related disorders have a defect in the regulation of EBV infected B-cells and these patients have high circulating numbers of these infected cells [ 21 ] . Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) results from the uncontrolled lymphoproliferation of EBV infected B-cells in transplant patients [ 22 23 ] . There are many known factors for the development of PTLD, among which is the presence of an active CMV infection [ 13 19 22 23 24 ] .
Such studies would be interesting since CMV infection has been suggested as a risk factor for the development of PTLD [ 22 24 ] . Investigators have showed that a large percentage of transplant patients who had developed PTLD also had CMV disease [ 22 30 ] . In addition to CMV being implicated as a factor for the development of PTLD, serological studies have shown that patients with an active CMV infection experienced a serological profile of EBV reactivation [ 22 31 32 ] . Cross reactivities between the two viruses were ruled out as a cause for the observed immunoreactivations.

Our experiments showed this to be a promising approach, though instrument development and miniaturization for this purpose will be challenging [ 14 ] .
However, following the development of antibiotics in the 1940s, the use of phages to treat and prevent infections disappeared from so-called Western Medicine, but it did survive in the former Soviet Union.
This question is not necessarily answerable at present, but the results do highlight the fact that development of specific protocols and phages for treatment in any one experimental model may be inadequate for treatment of the same bacterium under field conditions.
4) The results of this investigation, like those of Smith and Huggins and others, support the potential of phage for treating bacterial infections and the development of experimental infection models to evaluate and optimize the efficacy of antibiotic as well as phage treatment protocols.
Genomic analyses have recently revealed a large gene family of 21 polymorphic outer membrane proteins (Pmps) with predicted outer membrane localization in C. pneumoniae [ 7 10 11 ] . The function of this gene family in chlamydial growth and development remains unknown.
This work is important in understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis, characterizing the human immune response to infection and guiding vaccine development.
The genetic relatedness of M. paratuberculosis with other mycobacterial subspecies has been the root cause of the lack of development of M. paratuberculosis -specific diagnostic tests.
Development of the PCR assay
In anticipation of future multiplex development and high-throughput processing, each of the unique upstream amplification primers was tagged with one of three fluorescent compounds.
We anticipate that the testing of a larger number of isolates from various geographic areas will ultimately lead to the development of an international Brucella fingerprint database that can be searched for epidemiological use.
Consequently, there is an urgent need for the development of novel therapies for the treatment of osteomyelitis.
Blots were first incubated overnight with gentle shaking at 4°C with rabbit anti-human TRAIL polyclonal antibodies (Cell Sciences, Inc., Norwood, MA) at a concentration of 0.2 μg/ml in Buffer A. Membranes were then washed the following day 3 times for 5 min in Buffer B with gentle shaking, then incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) diluted 1:5000 in Buffer A. Reactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) following exposure to X-ray film and subsequent film development.
Peptides that bind specific proteins of therapeutic interest in the yeast two-hybrid system have a variety of applications in drug development.
The tumor suppressor gene PTEN (also called MMAC1) has been found deleted or mutated in a great variety of human tumors and tumor cell lines [ 1 2 3 ] , and its tumor suppressing function has been confirmed in several in vitro studies [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ] . Mice which are homozygously deficient in wild-type PTEN die during embryonic development and harbor regions of increased cellular proliferation, whereas heterozygous mice are viable but spontaneously develop tumors of various origins [ 11 12 ] .
For this purpose, two probes were used; one was β-actin, the other was choA, which is clone A of a group of highly expressed mRNAs from Chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells [ 40 ] . The quantitation of the hybridized blots was performed using the AMBIS Radioanalytic Imaging System (Analytical Development Corporation, Colorado Springs, CO).
The development of a core functional intron would be interesting not only from an evolutionary perspective, but would also facilitate manipulation in the laboratory.
Together, RA and WS did many experiments which, although invisible here, are essential to the development of this project.
The human FHIT gene, located at the chromosome 3 fragile site FRA3B, is inactivated early in the development of many tumors [ 1 ] . Murine Fhit is also located at a fragile site [ 2 3 ] and mice heterozygous for disruption of Fhit , given low intragastric doses of the mutagen N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine, develop stomach and sebaceous tumors [ 4 ] that can be prevented by viral Fhit expression [ 5 ] . Fhit, a dimer of 147 amino acid subunits, is a member of the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily of nucleotide hydrolases and transferases [ 6 7 ] . Members of the Hint branch of the HIT superfamily are found in all forms of life [ 8 ] . The S. cerevisiae Hint homolog, Hnt1, and rabbit Hint possess adenosine monophosphoramidase activity that functions in yeast to positively regulate function of Kin28, Ccl1 and Tfb3, which constitute the kinase component of general transcription factor TFIIH [ 9 ] . A new Hint related protein, Aprataxin, is mutated in individuals with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia [ 10 11 ] and has a yeast homolog termed Hnt3 [ 9 ] . Members of the Fhit branch of the HIT superfamily have been found in fungi [ 12 13 ] , animals [ 2 14 15 ] and plants [ 7 ] and hydrolyze diadenosine tetraphosphate, diadenosine triphosphate and other 5'-5"'-dinucleoside polyphosphates.
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted signaling molecules of the TGF-β superfamily that have been implicated in the control of a host of critical developmental phenomena in the central and peripheral nervous systems [ 1 2 3 ] . BMP-5, one of the more prominently expressed BMPs in the nervous system, has been detected in multiple regions of the nervous system throughout development and into adulthood [ 3 4 5 6 ] , yet its biological activities in the nervous system are not well defined.
A role for BMP-5 in dorsal forebrain patterning has been proposed based on its expression in the dorsal midline of the developing forebrain and observations that ectopic expression of BMP-5 in the developing neural tube of chicks markedly downregulates ventral markers while maintaining dorsal markers [ 5 7 ] . Further support for BMP-5 regulation of early forebrain development has been provided by studies of Bmp5/Bmp7 double mutants [ 6 ] . However, reports that BMP-5 in the mouse brain exhibits peak expression levels in the adult striatum and brainstem and that maximal expression in the hippocampus and cerebellum occurs at E18 through PN1 and again in the mature nervous system [ 3 ] , suggest additional roles for BMP-5 during later stages of neural development and into adulthood.

BMP-5 is widely expressed in the nervous system throughout development and into adulthood [ 3 4 5 6 ] , yet the only function described for this growth factor thus far is dorsal patterning of the developing forebrain [ 5 6 7 ] . Our data suggest that BMP-5 may also regulate later stages of neural development, specifically dendritic morphogenesis.

BMP-6 and BMP-7 as well as dpp subgroup members, BMP-2 and BMP-4, have been shown to influence other aspects of sympathetic neuron development, such as differentiation of adrenergic sympathetic neurons from neural crest [ 13 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 ] and neuropeptide phenotype [ 39 ] . It will be of interest to determine if BMP-5 also exhibits functional redundancy with respect to these effects.
Earlier studies have demonstrated the expression of BMP-4 transcripts in developing avian sympathetic ganglia [ 49 ] , suggesting the presence of multiple BMPs in sympathetic ganglia throughout development.
These observations together with reports that BMP-5 is expressed at significant levels in the adult nervous system [ 3 ] suggest a potential role for BMP-5 in modulating dendritic morphology not only during development, but also in adult nervous systems.
These observations, together with previously published reports from other laboratories indicating significant levels of BMP-5 expression in the developing and adult nervous system [ 3 ] suggest a potential role for BMP-5 in modulating dendritic morphology not only during development, but also in adult nervous systems.
In order to foster genetic studies there has been increased emphasis on the development of appropriate phenotypes to describe cognitive functions such as attention (see, for example, [ 1 ] ). In general these efforts have used tasks that do not distinguish between different functions of attention.
The advantage of using an endophenotypic measure can be extended when information about the neuroanatomy physiology and development underlying performance on the task is available.
Studies of human development have shown that the executive attention network is related to effortful control as measured from caregiver reports of their child's behavior [ 47 ] . Effortful control has also been shown to be heritable in twin studies [ 27 ] using larger numbers of subjects and has been linked by behavioral studies to the ability to delay gratification, development of conscience and other aspects of self regulation [ 48 ] .

The Seven in Absentia (SinA) protein was discovered in Drosophila as a mediator of photoreceptor development [ 29 ] . Subsequently, SinA was shown to participate in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway [ 30 31 ] . The presence of a RING finger domain in the N-terminus of the mammalian homologue of SinA, "Siah", suggests it may be involved in targeting specific proteins for degradation in the proteasome as a ubiquitin ligase [ 32 ] . Two mammalian genes encoding Siah, Siah1 and 2, are known.
Although intense efforts are being directed toward the development of safe and effective viral vectors that permit the introduction of foreign genes into mammalian cells, chemical transfection continues to attract interest, not only because chemicals are less difficult to use from a technical standpoint, but also because this form of gene transfer may prove less toxic and immunogenic from a therapeutic perspective [ 1].
Estrogen deficiency has been implicated as a risk factor in the development of several neurodegenerative diseases [ 16, 17, 18] and estrogen replacement may result in improvement of cognitive function [ 19].
Finally, recent experiments on the molecular control of telencephalic development have highlighted a number of genes that influence neuron proliferation and differentiation of the striatum and other neighboring forebrain structures [ 18] [ 26 27 28 29 30 ] .
Interval mapping places the QTL for Bsc10a in the central portion of Chr 10 in proximity with a number of genes known to affect brain development.
This molecule is important in cerebral development.
The MARCKS-related protein gene is expressed in the striatum during early brain development in the rat [ 48].
The location of the QTL modulating striatal neuron number to the distal part of chromosome 19 places it in proximity to a number of genes that have been recently been shown to be important factors in telencephalic development, particularly Vax1 . Vax1 is a homeobox-containing gene and is a close relative of the Emx and Not genes.
Vax1 is localized during development to the anterior ventral forebrain, and is expressed in the striatum during embryogenesis [ 28].
In addition, Vax1 interacts with several molecules including sonic hedgehog, Pax2 , Pax6 , and Rx that are known to be important during development of the basal forebrain [ 27, 50].
NMDA receptors containing NR2B subunits are present in the neonatal forebrain, and over the course of development, they are replaced or supplemented with NR2A-containing receptors [ 13, 20].
These data indicate that rod photoreceptor-mediated visual input may have a negative effect on GluR1 expression in normal retina during the course of development.
A major advance in spectral analysis was the development of Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis, or MESA by Burg [ 48 49 50 51 ] . The reader is referred to [ 39 ] for a full treatment of the topic.
A random distribution would imply that aggregate dynamics (initiation, development, and dispersal) are independent of that for neighboring aggregates.
Aggregates distributed further apart than random would imply a local competition for the molecules required for aggregate formation or development or alternatively, regionally increased levels of components which cause aggregate dispersal.
Conversely, a distribution of aggregates closer together than random could result from a local reduction in the rate of dispersal, or a regionally enhanced rate of initiation or development of new aggregates.
Jin Fan, James Swanson, Donald Pfaff and Michael Posner were responsible for the development and implementation of the ANT.
Following our previous development of a collection of analytical tools for the study of molecular and behavioral cycles [ 27 ] , we now provide intensively performed examples of the analysis of molecular rhythms in isolated tissues from Drosophila.
The development of analytical strategies for analyzing biological time-series will continue to be important as new real-time methods (potentially including images of tissues) provide greater access to molecular and physiological cycles.
The neurotrophins play crucial functions in the interaction of muscles with their innervating neurons during development and in the adult vertebrate organism.
Three neurotrophins, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5 are known to contribute to the development, maintenance, and functioning of the neuromuscular system.
Each of these three neurotrophins is expressed differentially in muscle during development, in the adult and in response to injury.
NT-3 is the most abundantly expressed of the three neurotrophins during embryonic muscle development, followed by NT-4/5 and BDNF [ 1 2 ] . After birth, NT-3 and NT-4/5 are down-regulated in muscle whereas BDNF continues to be expressed at low levels [ 1 ] . BDNF mRNA is expressed in myocytes in the adult muscle [ 3 ] . Essentially nothing is known about BDNF gene expression in fish muscle.
The molecular mechanisms that induce BDNF gene expression in muscle during development, maintain basal expression in the adult muscle and dynamically regulate BDNF mRNA in muscle in response to neuromuscular activity and injury are not known.
The relative abundance of BDNF transcripts in total RNA dramatically increases in the first 7 days of development and plateaus by 10 days pf [ 4 ] .
Total RNA from whole juvenile fish was also analyzed, as it should contain all exons that are expressed at this stage of development.
We did not assay RNA from these early stages of development.
Exon 1b appears to play a more limited role during development, and possibly in muscle injury and regeneration.
This possibility is consistent with our previous in situ hybridization analyses, which revealed BDNF expression in the peripheral YSL [ 35 ] . Some of the labeled platelets end up in cells of the embryo and persist up to 2 days of development.
Collective results have critical implications for the profound re-organizational effects of relatively small focal injuries early in development, specifically to affect distributed systems throughout the brain and in particular the cerebral cortex.
Study 2 assessed the effects of P1 induced microgyria in male rats across three stages of development.
Brn3c is a POU domain factor that is crucial for inner ear hair cell development.
The initial development and partial differentiation of hair cells in Brn3c mutants could possibly lead to some neurotrophin expression in these cells to sustain sensory neurons through embryonic development and beyond.
The initial development and partial differentiation of hair cells in Brn3c mutants could possibly lead to some neurotrophin expression in these cells to sustain sensory neurons through embryonic development and beyond.
The comparatively high level of NT-3 expression in Brn3c null mutant cochlea, which has been shown to be the neurotrophin most prominently supporting spiral sensory neurons [ 6 9 14 ] , is in agreement with the normal development of cochlear innervation in newborn Brn3c null mutants.
Development of PPAR agonists that retain the antiatherogenic activity but dismiss the proatherogenic activities will be of great value [ 26 ] .
This group of compounds may be useful in future development of pharmacological agents against cholesterol oxide induced cytotoxicity.
This may be the case as GABA can increase intracellular proton levels by intensifying bicarbonate ion conductance through a GABA-gated channel [ 15 ] which may act as a "developmental handshake" and regulate neuronal differentiation [ 16 ] . The chloride channel, an integral part of the GABA a receptor, has been implicated in embryonic development [ 17 ] . GABA receptors are first seen at the time the neural tube formation [ 18 ] . Binding sites to GABA agonists and antagonists and the expression of GABA receptor mRNAs are seen starting at 4 days of development and peak at 10-15 days, corresponding to the time of neural tube formation [ 19 ] . Many neurotransmitters, including GABA, are growth factor candidates for the CNS [ 20 21 22 ] .

Work in this laboratory has shown lags in neuromuscular development associated with excessive zinc exposure during neural tube formation and, possibly, accompanying narrowing of the vertebral arches [ 26 ] . Another curious finding of this study is that widening of the vertebral arch occurs with either the GABAa agonist muscimol or the antagonist bicuculline.
GABA is a well-documented neurotrophic agent involved in brain development [ 27 28 29 30 ] . Most of the work done on the effects of GABA and neural development has been done on embryos and embryonic tissue well past the neural tube stage [ 27 31 32 ] . However, there is evidence of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and GABA receptor expression about the time of neural tube formation [ 27 ] . Given that GABA is important to neural development, and the early developmental time frame of the GABA system, it is logical that agents active at the GABA receptor (ethanol, BDZs) can have adverse consequences on CNS development.

GABAb receptor effects have been little studied and the role of the GABAb receptor in neural development is little known and should be more thoroughly investigated.
An understanding of the potential neurotoxic and/or neuroprotective effects of domoic acid in neonatal rats will ultimately lead to a better understanding of domoic acid's effect in neonatal human development.
This concept is supported by the established fact that glutamate receptors are highly conserved between mammals [ 26 ] . Ultimately studies contributing to the characterization of the early biochemical as well as cellular events subsequent to an intoxication with the marine toxin domoic acid will yield new insights for the rationale development of novel therapeutic interventions for the prevention and treatment of amnesic shellfish poisoning.
Deficiency of the EP2 receptor is associated with a defect in counteracting vasopressor effect of PGE2 [ 7 ] and the development of salt sensitive hypertension [ 8 ] , suggesting a predominant normal vasodepressor role of EP2 receptor in blood pressure regulation.
The acid form, retinoic acid, is a pleiotropic hormone which regulates gene expression in embryonic development, epithelial cell differentiation, hematopoeisis, and tumor cell formation.
The development of inhibitors which can target individual ALDH enzymes provides one approach for addressing the role of a specific ALDH enzyme in the oxidation of retinal to retinoic acid in a given cell type.
Membrane suspensions were filtered through Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters with a 48-sample Brandel cell harvester (Biomedical Research and Development, Gaithersburg, MD).
However, at analgesic doses, opioid receptor agonists or partial agonists can induce unwanted side effects such as ventilatory depression [ 1 2 ] and the development of physical tolerance and dependence [ 3 4 ] . Thus, the search for opioid ligands which possess analgesic effect and lack untoward effects has been a sought after goal of the medical community.
The resulting dramatic enhancement in the efficiency of light capture for photosynthesis apparently provided a strong evolutionary pressure for development of the ability of photosynthetic organisms to synthesize Chl b or Chl c [ 44 ] .
For example, L91 is a 'single T-DNA' locus that causes homozygosity-dependent cosuppression of its GFP-COP1 transgene and of the endogenous COP1 gene at the rosette stage of development (type L=late silencing), which in turn results in a characteristic dwarfing and other aspects of a cop1 -like phenotype [ 28 ] . In contrast, E82 (type E=early) is an oligomeric T-DNA locus that causes homozygosity-dependent COP1 endogene silencing at the seedling stage, in particular deetiolation in dark-grown seedlings.
In plant cells V-ATPases are responsible for the deacidification of the cytosol and the energization of secondary transport processes across the tonoplast, as well as in the endocytotic and secretory pathways [ 12 ] . In addition, the vacuolar type ATPase is thought to be primarily responsible for the acidification and expansion of the large central vacuole [ 12 13 14 15 ] . In plants a critical event in growth and development is the maturation and expansion of the central vacuole.
What is lacking in our knowledge of vacuolar type ATPases is a sense of what purpose these multigene family proteins may serve in the cellular milieu and how they participate in the growth, development, and metabolism of higher plants.
Seedlings are undergoing dramatic and rapid vacuole biogenesis to allow for rapid growth at this stage of development and therefore would be expected to require a higher level of subunit A expression than other more terminally differentiated organs.
Additional sugar-response mutants have been identified by taking advantage of the fact that high concentrations of exogenous sugars (glucose or sucrose) inhibit early seedling development of wild-type Arabidopsis.
For reasons that remain unclear, mannose inhibits seed germination and early seedling development at concentrations that are 100-200 fold lower than the concentrations of glucose required to exert similar effects [ 19 46 47 48 50 ] . As shown in Figure 2, growth on low (1.
27 to 0.33 M) concentrations of glucose or sucrose has been shown to severely inhibit development of Arabidopsis seedlings [ 33 46 47 48 49 50 55 ] . Most seedlings grown on high-sugar media lack true leaves and have cotyledons that have undergone little expansion, even after two to three weeks of growth.
27 to 0.33 M) of exogenous sugars on seedling development within 2 to 3 days of the start of imbibition [ 47 ] . Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether seedlings become resistant to the inhibitory effects of high sugar concentrations on seed storage lipid mobilization within the same time frame.
As shown in Figure 5, seedlings sown directly on 0.27 M glucose exhibit little shoot development after 10 days of growth.
Several groups of Arabidopsis mutants that are resistant to the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of exogenous glucose or sucrose on early seedling development have been isolated [ 46 47 48 49 50 ] . A representative sugar-insensitive ( sis ) mutant, the sis5-1/abi4-101 mutant, was analyzed to determine whether mutants of this type can also exhibit altered responses to the effects of exogenous glucose on lipid metabolism.
This result indicates that mutations that alleviate the negative effects of exogenous sugars on early seedling development can also reduce glucose-mediated inhibition of seed storage lipid breakdown.
Interestingly, wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings were shown previously to become insensitive to sugar-mediated inhibition of early seedling development within 2 to 3 days of the start of imbibition [ 47 ] . In addition, seedlings of Brassica napus , a close relative of Arabidopsis, undergo a dramatic metabolic shift during the same time period [ 67 ] . Approximately 2 days after the start of imbibition, B. napus seedlings shift from being dependent on lipid breakdown to being dependent on photosynthesis for sugar formation.
The similar timing with which these events occur suggests that completion of the metabolic transition from lipid breakdown to photosynthesis as the primary source of sugars results in loss of sensitivity to the negative effects of sugars on lipid breakdown and early seedling development.
However, exogenous sugars can completely compensate for mutations that disrupt the glyoxylate cycle [ 58 ] . This finding suggests that the negative effects of high concentrations of exogenous sugars on early seedling development and seed storage lipid breakdown are not the result of sugar-mediated inhibition of the glyoxylate cycle.
Further experiments will be required to clarify the relationship between inhibition of early seedling development and seed storage lipid breakdown by exogenous sugars.
Enriching the AFLP or specific adaptor-amplified DNA fragments is a simple and efficient approach for SSR isolation and has been successfully applied to a number of plant genomes [ 12 28 29 30 31 32 ] . By employing the modified procedures from other plant species, corresponding isolating protocols were established in peanut for development of microsatellites through this study.
The rate of redundancy was high in peanut, while it was very low in cotton [ 31 ] . It decreased the efficacy of development of microsatellites in peanut.
Vascular wall remodeling in response to hemodynamic alterations has been known closely related to lesion development in the arterial wall [ 21 22 23 ] . Arterial wall shear stress is proven to be a critical factor in regulation of vessel diameter.
It is known that TGF-β3 plays a role in cardiac morphogenesis, mammary gland development and wound healing and that TGF-β3 is involved in fine-tuned interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells and their products [ 34 ] . The exact role of TGF-β3 in vascular remodeling response remains unclear.
In this meta-analysis, we estimated incidence rates based on duration of drug exposure and compared these to expected incidence rates in order to obtain unbiased estimates of relative risk for the development of AR and MR.
0%) seen in the CARDIA study [ 27 ] and considered the time course of new valve disease development to commence at age 35 (the ending age of the CARDIA study), the unexposed incidence would have been approximately half the rate we used and the relative risks doubled.
These findings lend strong support to the view that fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine are potent causal factors in the development of both aortic and mitral valvular heart disease.
Each Tanner stage is associated with important changes in genital development and sexual hormone profiles, which could have an impact on adipose tissue distribution and glucose and lipid profiles.
Genital development was evaluated with the criteria of Tanner [ 35 ] , and was performed with a questionnaire and physical exam by an experienced physician, in which stage 1 is prepubertal, stage 2 is initial development of the genitalia, stages 3 and 4 are intermediate, and stage 5 is mature.

Stage of sexual maturation in the girls was determined on the basis of a combination of menarcheal status and breast and pubic hair development [ 36 ] . The stages of sexual maturation were performed with a questionnaire and physical exam done by an experienced physician as follow: premenarcheal with no secondary sexual development (stage 1).
Stage of sexual maturation in the girls was determined on the basis of a combination of menarcheal status and breast and pubic hair development [ 36 ] . The stages of sexual maturation were performed with a questionnaire and physical exam done by an experienced physician as follow: premenarcheal with no secondary sexual development (stage 1).
Premenarcheal with some secondary sexual development (stage 2); premenarcheal at the time of study but attained menarche within 6 months (stage 3); postmenarcheal with secondary sexual development not yet mature (stage 4); and postmenarcheal with secondary sexual development (stage 5).
Premenarcheal with some secondary sexual development (stage 2); premenarcheal at the time of study but attained menarche within 6 months (stage 3); postmenarcheal with secondary sexual development not yet mature (stage 4); and postmenarcheal with secondary sexual development (stage 5).
Premenarcheal with some secondary sexual development (stage 2); premenarcheal at the time of study but attained menarche within 6 months (stage 3); postmenarcheal with secondary sexual development not yet mature (stage 4); and postmenarcheal with secondary sexual development (stage 5).
Data from the subjects were presented by specific age group, which we think may approximate the criteria of Tanner [ 35 ] for genital development.
These observations underscore the need for research efforts directed at the development of effective interventions for obese adolescents.
A final clinical feature of SSZ toxicity in our patient was the development of seizures.
Endothelial cell adhesion molecules ('ECAMs') play essential roles in the development of chronic inflammation by recruiting leukocytes, especially lymphocytes to tissues.
Among the adhesion molecules up-regulated in IBD, MAdCAM-1, the mucosal cell adhesion molecule, is thought to be preeminent in the development of chronic gut inflammation.
Several studies have indicated that T helper (Th1) immune response has important roles in the development of IBD [ 48 49 50 ] . Moreover, dysregulation of cytokine networks is involved in Th1-dominant immune responses in IBD [ 48 49 50 ] . Among the Th1 cytokines, TNF-α is thought to be perhaps the most important cytokine responsible for driving the onset and evolution of IBD.
Such partnerships also allow for the development of a consistent, positive message about nursing home issues to all outside parties.
This led to the development of detailed forms (or "checklists") that nursing home staff and QIO staff could use to assess whether or not recommended care processes for the clinical topic of focus were in place at the nursing home.
Improvements in the management of patients with thalassemia major in the past four decades have resulted in "one of the most dramatic alterations in morbidity and mortality associated with a genetic disease" [ 2 ] . Regular red blood cell transfusions extend survival, eliminate complications of anemia, inhibit bone marrow hyperactivity, and support normal growth and development in patients with thalassemia major [ 3 ] . Unfortunately, regular transfusions also lead to the accumulation of tissue iron, loading the body's organs to the point of dysfunction and finally death in the second or third decade of life if left untreated [ 4 ] .
The cost effectiveness advantage of rapid test in the long term is the reduction of mistreatment in terms of drugs, costs, toxicity and development of resistance [ 34 ] . An important advantage of the availability of the rapid test that it does not depend on just one person but can be performed by all staff members of the health clinic.
Bacterial infections are responsible for the immediate cause of death of up to 30% of patients with HIV infection [ 7 ] . The purpose of this study was to describe the bacterial pathogens causing blood stream infection, identify the risk factors for the development of blood stream infection, and determine the impact of blood stream infection on the outcome of hospitalized patients with HIV.
This study describes the incidence of bacterial blood stream infection as well as its causative pathogens, risk factors for its development, and its impact on outcome in hospitalized patients with HIV.
Neutropenia is reported to be a risk factor for the development of bacterial infection in patients with HIV infection [ 4 5 6 14 16 ] . However, in our study, neither the prevalence of leukopenia nor the total white blood cell count was lower in patients with blood stream bacterial infection compared with patients without blood stream bacterial infection.
[ 14 ] , higher severity of illness, measured by APACHE II score, was associated in the present study with the development of bacterial blood stream infection.
The present study showed that the presentation with or the development of blood stream infection in hospitalized patients with HIV leads to poor outcome, as evidenced by increased mortality, length of hospital stay, and intensive care unit admission rate.
Negatively charged sulfated polymers were reported to have anti-HIV-1 activity and are being considered for development as topical microbicides.
Although there have been major developments in its diagnosis and treatment, the mortality rate of septic shock has progressively increased over the past few decades.
Bernard et al . [ 10 ] reported that, in patients with sepsis, treatment with ibuprofen reduced levels of prostacylin and thromboxane and decreased fever, tachycardia, oxygen consumption, and lactic acidosis, but did not prevent the development of shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and did not improve survival.
Author 2 NS carried out most experiments and contributed to the development of experimental techniques.
RSV infection in infancy cause severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia and may predispose children to the subsequent development of asthma, the most common chronic illness of childhood [ 1 ] . Many studies have indicated that chemokines can play an important role in the onset and severity of asthma and it has been shown that RSV infection of lung epithelial cells increases chemokine production, although the mechanisms involved are largely unknown [ 2 3 4 5 ] .
Such studies were expected to elucidate further the mechanisms involved in the antiviral/virucidal activity of CAP and to contribute to the potential development of microbicides combining two or more anti-HIV-1 compounds with distinct target sites.
Author 2 NS carried out most experiments and contributed to the development of experimental techniques.
[ 5 ] The need for determining hospitalization criteria led to the development of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) by the Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team.
Bioelectronic detection of nucleic acids on a miniature solid support is one of the first steps toward development of such an integrated detection device.
The bioelectronic detection platform described here includes disposable DNA chips and laboratory-based electronic readers and is a first-generation system that ultimately will facilitate the development of relatively low cost, arrayed nucleic acid-based tests.
To illustrate the development and use of the I-TRAP approach, we describe here the construction of the vectors, host strains, and library necessary to identify σ E-regulated genes of M. tuberculosis .
Recently, the apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) gene has been suggested to be a risk factor for the development of micro- and macrovascular complications in diabetic patients.
Thus, APOE is an important candidate gene for the development of microvascular complications in Type I diabetes patients.
The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of APOE gene polymorphism in the development of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy in Type I diabetes patients.
[ 9] suggested that lipid abnormalities may contribute to the development and progression of kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy.
The influence of the APOE gene polymorphism to the development of diabetic microangiopathy is uncertain.
The present study found no evidence for a role of the APOE gene polymorphism in genetic susceptibility for the development of diabetic retinopathy in Type I diabetes patients.
Named after Andreas Rett who first recognized the disorder in 1966 [ 2 ] , the syndrome is characterized by a constellation of clinical findings that have resulted in the establishment of clinical criteria for the diagnosis [ 3 ] . Common clinical features include early normal development until approximately 6-18 months of age followed by a period of developmental stagnation and subsequent regression, usually by 3 years of life.
Simple tests for genetic risk factors would permit the identification of individuals at high risk for development and rupture of aneurysms, consequently allowing diagnostic effort to be concentrated on a smaller group that is at higher risk.
Although etiologically diverse, inheritance is a significant contributor to the development of DCM.
Conduction disease preceded the development of dilated cardiomyopathy in the proband's family [ 1 10 ] . This indicates the necessity for careful documentation of a three-generation pedigree in the evaluation of patients with conduction system disease paying particular attention to sudden death, arrhythmia and bradycardia.
In the case of sickle cell disease, only a few genetic factors are known to influence the stroke risk [ 7 ] . For example, α-thalassemia is the only well characterized protective genetic factor [ 7 ] . Thus, genetic factors that lead to the development of cerebrovascular disease and stroke in children with Hb SS are not well understood.
While some of the risk factors leading to the development of cerebral vasculopathy and stroke in sickle cell disease (low hematocrit, elevated white blood cell count, normal complement of α-globin genes) have been identified in previous studies (CSSCD, MCG cohort, and STOP), many remain unknown.
It is likely that the co-inheritance of one or more of these mutations in sickle cell disease would tip the balance toward a hypercoagulable state and act as an additional risk factor for the development of cerebrovascular disease.
These candidate genes will make it possible to study not only polymorphisms associated with a hypercoagulable state, but also to study the genes involved in pathways that may lead to the development of vasculopathy (genes involved in endothelial cell function, inflammation, and adhesion, platelet activation and responsiveness).
Therefore, a large case-control association study of the role of genes in the development of cerebrovascular disease and stroke risk based upon TCD, is likely to provide more accurate information and may resolve the controversial results obtained in smaller studies [ 5 ] . Furthermore, an attempt will be made to perform a subset analysis of patients who go on to have an ischemic stroke during the study period in terms of the associations with genetic polymorphisms.
All 28 polymorphisms in 20 candidate genes that we propose to study have been shown to be associated with a hypercoagulable state or have been shown to be involved in pathways leading to the development of vasculopathy and, therefore, have a high probability to be related to the TCD velocity phenotype.
While other animal models of hypertension can be employed to study the pathogenesis of hypertension, because of the rapid and reproducible development of renal failure, S rats provide a unique means to investigate the pathogenesis of hypertensive nephrosclerosis.
Recent studies have shown that apoptosis was accentuated in kidneys of S rats during development of nephrosclerosis [ 7 ] . These studies demonstrated increased numbers of TUNEL-positive cells, increased cytoplasmic nucleosome content and caspase-3 activation in kidneys of hypertensive S rats, compared to normotensive Sprague-Dawley control rats on the same high-salt diet.
In kidneys of S rats, associated with apoptosis was a temporal increase in expression of Fas, which was demonstrated using Western analysis of lysates of kidney cortex [ 7 ] . The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the site of expression and potential functional significance of Fas and FasL in the kidneys of S rats during development of hypertensive nephrosclerosis.
These findings were observed by day 21 of study [ 7 ] . The present series of experiments demonstrated the diffuse sites of expression of Fas and FasL in the kidney and explored further the possibility that the Fas/FasL pathway was active during the development of hypertensive renal disease in this rodent model of hypertension.
A previous study suggested that the apoptotic process occurred early in the development of hypertension in this model [ 26 ] , so the data suggested that an apoptotic mechanism in addition to activation of the Fas/FasL pathway is also involved in development of hypertensive nephrosclerosis in S rats.

Variables with p < 0.05 in univariate analysis for a relationship with development of hospitalization for poisonings were entered into multivariate analysis as covariates.
Traditional animal models, such as mice, rats, rabbits or pigs do not develop typical renal disease when given either Stx or E. coli 0157:H7 [ 14 ] . Further, animal models that most closely reflect human HUS are only in the early stages of development [ 14 ] . Hence, the cell culture system remains the most reasonable means to assess an effect of sex steroids on renal cell Stx-1 responsiveness; such systems have clearly been demonstrated to be responsive to sex steroids (e.g.

GP participated in the study design and development of the analysis plan for the study.
[ 12 ] on the G448A polymorphism of the β-fibrinogen gene suggested that mechanisms linking fibrinogen and the development of cerebrovascular disease may be different in men and women.
Steroid hormones play a vital role in the growth of normal mammary gland tissue, as well as, the development and progression of breast tumors.
This necessitated the development of domain specific antibodies.
As mentioned above, IL-6 is a cytokine that functions as a necessary growth factor in several cancer types, most studied in multiple myeloma [ 12 ] . It is an essential factor in the development and maintenance of B cell neoplasms [ 13 ] , and likely plays an important role in many other types of cancer.
An association between autocrine IL-6 and PCA has been known for some time [ 16 17 ] . The change in prostate cell phenotype from paracrine IL-6-stimulated to autocrine IL-6-stimulated is believed to be a contributing factor in the progression from benign hyperplasia to neoplasia [ 17 ] . IL-6 is also implicated in the development of cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy in PCA patients [ 18 19 ] . In other studies, a chimeric protein consisting of an anti-IL-6 Ab fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin was found to inhibit proliferation of prostate carcinoma cell lines [ 20 ] . Exogenous IL-6 activated androgen responsive gene expression in the absence of androgens in human LNCaP cells [ 21 ] . More work is needed to clarify the role of IL-6 in prostate neoplasia.
While there is some evidence suggesting IL-6-mediated neoplasia in PCA development [ 17 22 ] , a system suitable for following the transformation of prostate cells during PCA development remains lacking.

While prostatic epithelium is resistant to neoplastic transformation, it is not resistant to the development of hyperplasia.
The importance of STAT3 activation via IL-6 in prostatic cancer development has been suggested by previous investigators.
To address these questions, one promising approach would be the development of specific immunohistochemical markers capable of improving the sensitivity and reliability of methods currently employed to detect precursor lesions in histologic and cytologic specimens [ 9, 10].
Because proliferation is a requirement for lung cancer development, markers specific for cell proliferation are expected to prove useful.
The mice show systemic tolerance to Tag, mounting neither humoral nor cellular immune responses to Tag upon immunization of purified protein [ 25 26 ] . Rip1-Tag2 mice display a reproducible pattern of multistage tumor development, from normal islets to hyperplastic/dysplastic islets, to angiogenic islets, to varying grades of solid tumor, with a well-defined angiogenic progression [ 27 ] . All Rip1-Tag2 mice succumb to hypoglycemia and tumor burden by 13-16 weeks.
The splenocytes were derived from T cell receptor transgenic mice that preferentially enhanced development of CD4 +T cells recognizing a peptide within the SV40 large T oncoprotein [ 28 ] . While the transfer of naive splenocytes from the TCR transgenic mice had no effect on tumor development, sub-lethal radiation prior to lymphocyte transfer resulted in significant reduction in tumor burden in both intervention and regression trials.

Prostate cancer is one of the major diseases that pose serious health problems for aging men [ 1 ] . It is generally believed that androgen has a significant role in the development and progress of this disease [ 2 ] . Changes in the growth response of cancer cells to androgen ablation and anti-androgen during the progress of the disease [ 3 4 5 6 ] suggest that multiple androgen-related signaling events are involved in neoplasia and disease progression.
Numerous studies have shown that polypeptide growth factors such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are mitogens for breast cancer cells [ 6 7 8 9 ] . The IGF-I and IGF-II signal through a common tyrosine kinase receptor, the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), and have mitogenic and cell survival actions that may promote tumor development.
This is consistent with previous observations that M6P/IGF2R knockout mice displayed generalized increased growth and cardiomygaly (resulting from cardiac myocyte hyperplasia) [ 34 ] , and that antisense-mediated reduction of M6P/IGF2R expression enhances tumorigenicity in JEG-3 cells [ 43 ] . Thus, loss or mutation of M6P/IGF2R may contribute to development and progression of tumors via different pathways: by increasing the mitogenic activity of IGF-II and decreasing the apoptotic signaling of TGF-β and lysosomal proteases.
Despite continuing decreases in incidence and mortality rates, cancers of the colon and rectum remain the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the North America [ 1 2 ] . The decline in incidence, and hence mortality, from colorectal cancers is most likely attributable to an increase in recommendations to perform routine screening on average risk individuals and to improved screening techniques [ 2 ] . In addition, there is ever advancing knowledge into the pathogenic mechanism of cancer and resulting strides in the development of more efficacious therapies.
[ 9 ] , but employed far greater doses of aspirin (45 and 90 mg/kg/day) and reported no dose-response relationship and a maximal suppression of 55% [ 7 ] . Furthermore, in the rat model of azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis, aspirin has also only been found to inhibit aberrant crypt foci and tumour development by no more than 65% [ 4 39 ] . Coincidentally, epidemiological data also report reductions in the 40-50% range [ 13 14 15 32 ] . However, whether this can be used as an argument to support the notion that aspirin is only able to suppress tumour formation by 50% is difficult to extrapolate because two different end points are being examined (i.e.
Shiff and Rigas [ 45 ] indicate that NSAIDs may to affect colorectal cancer development via one or more of the following four areas: (1) COX-mediated carcinogen activation, (2) cell proliferation, (3) apoptosis and (4) immune surveillance.
As in the Framingham cohort, the choice of bone for BMD measurement in NHANES I was the metacarpal [ 2 ] . Much has been written about the optimal choice of bone for BMD measurement, though no clear preference has dominated this literature [ 15 16 17 ] . Because we assumed that the most direct consequences of diminished BMD would be osteoporosis and hip fracture, associations of BMD with hip fracture and the development of osteoporosis were investigated in order to establish the validity of this BMD measurement in this cohort.
As anticipated, in the NHEFS, diminished BMD is significantly associated with the development of osteoporosis and hip fracture (Table 2).
Because the association of estrogen exposure and uterine cancer development is far less controversial than estrogen and breast cancer risk [ 4 ] , the veracity of BMD as a measure of estrogen exposure is supported by the significant positive association of BMD with uterine cancer incidence (Table 3).
In 1990 the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference [ 1 ] concluded that breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiation is an appropriate method of primary treatment for the majority of women with early stage breast cancer (AJCC stages [ 2 ] I, IIA, and IIB).
It has also been shown that aspirin inhibited nitrosamine induced lung carcinogenesis [ 27 ] , and it reduced COX-2 enzyme levels in lung cancer cell lines [ 28 ] . Further support for a potential role of the COX-2 pathway in lung cancer development comes from several investigations that demonstrated COX-2 overexpression in human lung tumors, specifically NSCLC [ 29 30 31 32 ] and precursor lesions [ 33 ] . While COX-2 expression was generally shown to be increased in NSCLC and to a much lesser extent in SCLC, the role of COX-2 expression in latter tumor type is difficult to determine, due to the fact that the numbers of SCLC tumors examined in these studies was very small.
The mitogenic role played by Wnts in normal CNS development also supports the concept that the pathway could promote growth in the brain [ 21 22 ] . In order to test this hypothesis we created transgenic mice in which the Wnt pathway was aberrantly activated in the CNS.
Wnt signaling is known to play a critical role in the development of the brain, and the midbrain and cerebellum do not form in animals lacking Wnt-1 [ 23 ] . Furthermore, targeted disruption of the frizzled-4 gene results in cerebellar abnormalities in mice [ 24 ] . Transgene expression from the PrP promoter is extremely low during embryonic development, with high-level postnatal expression largely restricted to neurons and glia of the CNS [ 25 ] . Transgenic mice expressing either wild-type or mutant β-catenin were generated so that a range of pathway activation could be examined.

To increase the probability of brain tumor development, several transgenic lines (WT-1 and Mut-1,2,3) were crossed onto a p53-deficient background.
The growth and metastasis of tumors depend on the development of an adequate blood supply via angiogenesis.
It has been reported that dysfunction of the p53/MDM-2 pathway can be found in more than two-thirds of angiosarcomas; thus, mutant p53 influences the development of angiosarcoma not only by affecting growth and apoptosis control but also by up-regulating VEGF (Chinrugi et al.
Thus, the high coincidental expression of iNOS and VEGF and p53 protein accumulation may be important events to enhance gastric carcinogenesis and poorly clinical features and may be useful biomarkers to assess risk for the development of GC.
[ 28 29 30 31 32 ] In this report, two modulators of 5-FU were used in a sequential manner, anticipating an enhancement of the efficacy of 5-FU before the development of 5-FU resistance and subsequent disease progression.
We report on the development, implementation and evaluation of these non-traditional learning tools into an adult educational program for lay educators in the Witness Project of Buffalo.
Five educational tools that are not normally incorporated into community-based learning programs were implemented: educational contracts, vocabulary development, accessing prior knowledge, question and answer training format, and role playing.
This particular phase (creating new stories) of their development did not generally occur until the witness role models had been giving programs 6 months.
Identification of biomarkers that provide rapid and accessible readouts of drug exposure, activity, toxicity or efficacy is becoming increasingly important in the clinical development of novel molecularly targeted therapeutics.
The implications of gene expression profiling applications such as this one in the clinical development of novel molecular therapies are discussed.
A recent report describes an expression profiling approach as applied to bone marrow samples before and after treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571 in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ 26 ] . This work clearly demonstrates utility of the approach in investigation of drug-resistance development in hematological malignancies.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is diagnosed in over 40,000 Americans each year, resulting in over 12,000 annual deaths [ 1 ] . Carcinomas of the head and neck are often associated with multiple areas of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ (CIS) in noncontiguous mucosa, as well as with the development of second primary cancers of the aerodigestive tract.
The concept of "field cancerization" hypothesizes that regions of the mucosal epithelium, although normal in appearance, are "preconditioned" by chronic exposure to carcinogenic agents, thus priming them for the subsequent development of invasive lesions [ 2 ] .
The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (M6P/IGF2R) maps to chromosome location 6q25-27 [ 14 ] ; a chromosomal region predicted to contain a head and neck tumor suppressor gene [ 10 11 ] . It encodes for a receptor that functions in intracellular lysosomal enzyme trafficking, transforming growth factor beta activation, and IGF2 degradation (reviewed in [ 15 16 ] ). Granzyme B internalization by the M6P/IGF2R is also required for cytotoxic T cells to induce apoptosis in cells targeted for death, resulting in this receptor being referred to as a "death receptor" [ 17 ] . Elevated IGF2 levels during murine development arising from M6P/IGF2R deficiency result in cardiac abnormalities, cleft palate, fetal overgrowth and perinatal lethality [ 15 18 ] . Furthermore, large offspring syndrome frequently observed in cloned animals is associated with epigenetic changes in gene regulation and decreased M6P/IGF2R expression [ 19 ] . Thus, the M6P/IGF2R plays a crucial role in regulating mammalian fetal growth and development.

The development of second primaries was independent of the M6P/IGF2R mutation status in the primary tumor (p = 0.8).
M6P/IGF2R is normally imprinted in mice with only the maternal copy of the gene being expressed [ 41 ] . In contrast, both copies of the M6P/IGF2R are expressed in humans because genomic imprinting at this locus was lost in the primate lineage approximately 75 million years ago [ 42 ] . Importantly, restoration of biallelic M6P/IGF2R expression in mice results in a marked reduction in offspring weight late in embryonic development that persists into adulthood [ 43 ] . This demonstrates that M6P/IGF2R allelic loss or haploid insufficiency markedly enhances cell proliferation and/or survival during fetal development.

In the lens, alpha-crystallin also associates with type III intermediate filament proteins and the beaded filament proteins CP49 and CP115, and correct beaded filament assembly has been shown depend on the presence of alpha-crystallin [ 16 ] . Beaded filament mRNA levels are greatly increased in differentiating lens epithelium and have been suggested as a pan-specific marker for lens fiber development [ 17 ] . Alpha-crystallin has also been shown to interact directly with DNA [ 18 ] . In transfected CHO cells, alphaB has also been shown to ectopically localize to interphase nuclei, suggesting a role for this protein in the nucleus [ 19 ] . A nuclear role for alphaB in the lens was supported by the findings that a subset of lens epithelial cells derived from alphaB knockout mice demonstrated hyperproliferation and genomic instability [ 20 ] . In addition, the administration of exogenous alpha-crystallin to primary bovine lens epithelial cell cultures resulted in the formation of lentoid bodies, consistent with a role for these proteins in lens differentiation [ 21 ] . These findings indicate that alpha-crystallin may have a multitude of in vivo functions.
Future studies with defined objectives to address the development and progression of morphological changes seen in this study are being designed.
Stress proteins have been shown to be expressed in non-stressed cells during development and differentiation [ 25 ] . Hsps were shown to be expressed during the differentiation of mammalian osteoblasts and promelocytic leukemia cells [ 26 ] . In addition, hsp expression has been shown to accompany growth arrest in human B lymphocytes [ 27 ] and macrophage differentiation of HL 60 cells [ 28 ] . During myogenic differentiation, mRNA for alphaB increases in conjunction with the induction of mRNA for myogenin, the earliest known event in myogenesis [ 29 ] . The addition of exogenous alpha-crystallin to primary bovine lens epithelium was shown to induce rapid changes in cell shape, leading to the formation of lentoid bodies [ 21 ] . These studies strongly suggest that the hsp family of proteins has other functions in addition to protecting proteins and cells during stress.
Second, due to the possibility that prior infection with HHV-6 might be directly or indirectly protective against tumor development.
At 11 months, there was a concern about possible failure to thrive, nevertheless, her current growth and development at seven years of age have been adequate.
Gross motor development was delayed but other developmental axes were intact.
Although it has been suggested that rapid sexual maturation may have long-term consequences for the development of obesity among women [ 6 ] , our results indicate that it is more likely that childhood obesity influences both menarcheal age and adult obesity.
Among women, black/white differences in BMI levels become apparent after age 12 y [ 27 ] , suggesting that adolescence may be a critical period [ 28 29 ] for the development of obesity.
The role of impulsivity in this correlation is important, given that impulsive behavior is common in adolescents with ADHD, pointing to a connection between ADHD and development of obesity, an idea consistent with our clinical observation that impulsive eating behaviors are common in adult and adolescent OB+ADHD patients.
Although most current administrative systems include time lags that diminish their utility, the development of on-line transaction processing between clinicians and payers may reduce or eliminate that deficiency.
To overcome attitudes and office systems that often emphasize treatment versus preventive care, the tool must be developed and "sold" on points salient and compelling to physician values, beliefs, and experiences [ 20 21 ] . In sum, a comprehensive assessment of the targeted environment is essential to the process of intervention development and application.
The PRECEDE-PROCEED model [ 22 ] , a comprehensive health promotion-planning model, provided the framework for this study's incremental progression towards intervention visualization, development, and adoption.
Physician formative involvement in the tool development began with the convening of a focus group of 12 peer-identified primary care physician Opinion Leaders.
The researchers discussed the development of the themes throughout the analysis, reaching consensus on eight final emergent themes.
The identified concepts will be applied towards the development of a survey that will be mailed to a randomized sample, stratified by county, practice specialty, and physician gender, of WNY PCP to test and refine the characterization of regional perceptions and experiences.
The focus group and survey findings will then be applied in the development of the practice tool.
Our results do not support the notion that aspirin plays a role in the development of pancreatic cancer.
From these results, potential cost-benefit analyses of NRL glove use can be developed to aid in policy development and implementation.
[ 23 26 32 37 40 41 ] . To address issues related to initiation and compliance with prenatal care, and its association with infant mortality in D.C, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the NIH Office of Research on Minority Health (ORMH) sponsored this study of barriers and motivators of prenatal care as identified by vulnerable, hard to reach populations.
Real creativity is needed to include fathers in development of prenatal care services, as well as in the health care delivery system to provide relevant, easily accessible care.
This assessment stimulated and guided reform efforts that were initiated in December 1992 through a cooperative project among the AMoH, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and CDC.
Since 1996, this HIS reform activity has been self-sustained with no additional monetary support from USAID [ 6 ] . In 1996, the AMoH created a national HIS program for the development and reform of the HIS and the Armenian National Health Analytic-Information Centre [ 18 ] . The system has been transformed into a comprehensive HIS and includes chronic diseases, maternal and child health, and injury data.
A comprehensive HIS includes the capacity to obtain data from vital registries, clinical, administrative, and other records; from provider and population-based surveys and sentinel systems for infectious and chronic diseases, and disabilities; and maternal and child health, nutrition, and program implementation indicators, including access, coverage, and service quality [ 1 ] . This reform activity should include the development of an indicator monitoring system based on selected essential, action-oriented indicators of health status, service performance, and resources that can be used for decision-making at the local level.
Previous liver or thyroid disease, and concurrent insults to the liver (such as from alcohol, dehydration, an oral contraceptive pill, recreational drugs, and other drugs that can damage the liver) may be related to the development of many severe or prolonged adverse reactions to mefloquine.
Although all questions asked of the subjects refer to the two weeks prior to development of cryptosporidiosis and the statement is reiterated at several points during the questionnaire, it is likely that people do not recall exact consumption but tend to describe their usual patterns when asked about routine habits such as consumption of drinking water.
This is consistent with studies of other enteric pathogens [ 47 48 ] . In fact, intestinal protozoa are the most common infecting organisms identified in travelers with chronic diarrhea; the precise etiology of traveler's diarrhea is unclear but it is believed that duration of stay, hygiene, and level of socioeconomic development in the host country are associated with acquisition of infection [ 48 ] . The current study was unable to evaluate any of these factors because of limited sample size, but it was observed that 7 of the 13 cases (50.
Cryptosporidium oocysts have an ubiquitous geographic distribution and can be detected in most surface drinking water sources [ 8 ] . The oocysts are resistant to environmental degradation [ 9 ] , survive chlorination water treatment, and are too small (4 to 6 microns) to be removed by conventional water filters [ 6 ] . Risk factors for acquiring cryptosporidiosis have been determined primarily in studies of community-wide outbreaks, and drinking water has been implicated as the source of these outbreaks [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 ] . Case-control studies in AIDS patients have also been conducted during outbreaks [ 12 15 ] , but levels of endemic risk in the United States remain uncertain, even though there is great concern for diarrheal disease associated with drinking water in this population [ 16 17 ] . Because defining the risk associated with drinking tap water is particularly important for counseling immunocompromised patients on reducing their risk of cryptosporidiosis, we conducted a case-control study among persons with AIDS in San Francisco to test the hypothesis that the pattern of tap water consumption is associated with the development of endemic cryptosporidiosis.
The unadjusted, matched odds ratios for the occurrence of cryptosporidiosis according to exposure to non-drinking water sources are shown in Table 3. Neither sexual activity, sex with a partner with diarrhea, nor travel outside of San Francisco were associated with the development of cryptosporidiosis.
Assuming a causal relationship between tap water consumption and the development of cryptosporidiosis in persons with AIDS, the PAF was 85%; that is, the proportion of cases in San Francisco AIDS patients attributable to tap water consumption could have been as high as 85%.
This is the first population-based case-control study enrolling incident cases of cryptosporidiosis to evaluate and detect a strong association between an increasing pattern of tap water consumption and the development of cryptosporidiosis among AIDS patients in the United States.
SJ participated in development of the molecular assays and study design.
Development of an evidence-based, consensus statement regarding breast cancer screening, with broad endorsement, would support a single set of unambiguous guidelines for implementation across primary care settings.
The application of highly active antiretroviral treatment and the development of more effective chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections are likely to be associated with changes in the types and severity of pulmonary complications that we see in these patients.
Reports have suggested that responses to tuberculosis differ between men and women, and that barriers to early detection and treatment of tuberculosis may be greater for women than for men [ 5 ] . A 10-year study performed among Ethiopian Jews who immigrated to Israel found that women had an incidence rate of tuberculosis that was twice that of men (120 versus 69 cases per 100,000 population per year) [ 6 ] . In addition, studies have suggested that progression from tuberculosis infection to disease may be faster in women of reproductive age than men of the same age [ 7 8 ] . Nonetheless, there is an estimated 2:1 male to female ratio in the number of tuberculosis cases notified to public health authorities [ 9 ] , indicating that any increase in the risk of development of tuberculosis that reproductive stress may confer upon women is transient.
Cardiovascular diseases, a major health concern in industrialized countries [ 1 2 3 4 ] , include vasculopathies such as atherosclerosis [ 5 ] and autoimmune vascular diseases such as lupus [ 6 ] , graft versus host disease [ 7 ] , and systemic sclerosis [ 8 ] . Many factors are involved in the development and progression of these diseases including lifestyle (diet, smoking, and lack of physical exercise); genes, and environment [ 1 2 3 4 ] . Also, infectious agents, including both bacterial (Chlamydia) [ 9 10 ] , and viral (CMV) [ 11 12 ] , have been implicated.
All mice were housed in hepa filtered cages in the approved animal facility and monitored daily for the development of clinical manifestations of infection.
To both accelerate the development of vascular pathology and to deepen the immunocompromised state, these mice were irradiated with a sublethal dose of gamma radiation (300 Rads) at 4 months of age.
Vascular disease in the IFN-γR-/- group of mice began with development of an inflammatory infiltrate in the adventitia of aortas 3-4 weeks after infection in 30% of animals (Table 1) (Fig.
CMV invades the vascular endothelium with the development of both latency and intermittent shedding of the virus to distal tissues, often by detachment of infected endothelial cells.
Prior studies describe development of MCMV associated vascular lesions in large arterial vessels of mice.
injection of suckling mice induces vascular lesions in the aorta and pulmonary artery, which are characterized by cellular infiltrates containing T-lymphocytes [ 36 ] . A more recent study describes the development of MCMV induced vascular lesions in the aorta of both immunocompetent mice and those lacking IFN-γ responsiveness where IFN-γ is determined to be a major antiviral factor preventing the long term persistence of aortic vascular lesions [ 18 ] . The present study focused on neointima formation, which was seen only in immunocompromised mice.
Apoptosis of vascular endothelium may be the trigger that initiates the uncontrolled repair mechanism characterized by the proliferation of smooth muscle cells/myofibroblasts, leading to the development of neointima in MCMV induced vascular disease.
The development of CMV induced vasculopathies is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients.
Although the role of CMV infection in pathogenesis of vascular diseases in immunocompetent patients is less clear, epidemiological studies strongly suggest that chronic or latent infections may accelerate the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis and SSc.
It is crucial to identify factors responsible for contributing to the development of vascular pathology in order to develop better preventive as well as treatment modalities.
KN supervised development and implementation and sponsored the project.
in rats, where the anabolic effect of lovastatin on bone was at least partially due to their inhibiting effect on osteoclast development [ 28 ] . Similarly, in the mouse calvaria model Gasser et al.
It is estimated that 1.2 million new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer occur each year in the United States, and the majority of these are believed to result from heavy exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun [ 1 ] . The incidence of skin cancer is predicted to increase even further because of the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer [ 2 ] . The development of chemopreventive strategies for skin cancer is thus a high public health priority.
Residents of Arizona experience a three to seven times greater incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer than the general population in the United States [ 3 ] . Our goal is the development of oral agents that will complement primary skin cancer prevention.

While in vitro analyses of TGFβ1 levels in keloid and normal fibroblasts have yielded variable results [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 ] , higher levels of TGFβ1 receptors and Smad3 activation were recently reported in keloid fibroblasts [ 21 ] . Thus, procedures that lower TGFβ1 expression may help prevent keloid development [ 15 16 18 22 ] .
This suggests that body-site specific keloid formation may be dependent on the difference in the development and resolution of tension in the wound bed at nonglabrous vs. glabrous sites in keloid prone patients.
Rather it may be necessary to re-evaluate α-SMA expression in the early stages of keloid development, when tension within the wound bed is high.
Skin antigen-presenting cells (Langerhans cells) appear to play an important role in the initiating events that lead to the cytokine cascade that results in keratinocyte proliferation and development of psoriatic lesions [ 16 17 18 ] . Effective therapeutic approaches to psoriasis treatment, such as psoralen UV-A therapy (PUVA), which result in depletion of APCs in the skin [ 19 20 ] , and UV-B [ 21 ] , lead to one of the most sustained improvement in psoriasis.
Recently, the development of an inducible system based on the insect steroid ecdysone and the nuclear receptor that mediates its effect [ 7 ] has provided an alternative that may circumvent these limitations.
This clone, designated MBT2+RheoSwitch-2, was used for further development.
The clone exhibiting the highest level of induced gene expression was then used for further development.
The analysis of gene function during mammalian embryonic development relies heavily on the use of transgenic mice.
All embryos exhibited characteristic features of midgestation stages of development including normal rostral-caudal patterning, beating hearts, normal limb formation including the formation of fingers.
The most obvious is that it provides a mechanism for generating embryos that express alleles that are predicted, or known, to be detrimental to normal embryonic development, for example dominant-negative or gain-of-function alleles.
Indeed, the expression of dominant negative alleles that can potentially disrupt multiple members of a gene family has been used extensively in Xenopus laevis and has, for example, helped elucidate the action of fibroblast growth factors during mesoderm formation [ 19 ] . Such alleles are particularly useful when a null allele in the same gene causes a disruptive phenotype prior to the stage of development of interest.
Choosing a promoter that expresses the dominant negative allele later in development or in a specific cell type could potentially circumvent any early phenotype associated with a null allele.
Another important use of this procedure could be to identify transcriptional regulatory regions that control expression of specific genes during development.
Transgenic mice have been extensively used to identify regulatory elements that control gene expression in vivo [ 20 21 ] . This has, in turn allowed the elucidation of regulatory networks that control cell differentiation during development.
In sum, the availability of tetraploid aggregation-competent ES cells that support targeting of transgenes to the hprt locus should facilitate the rapid analysis of transcriptional regulatory elements in vivo as well as the phenotypic characterization of alleles that are incompatible with normal development.
In this report, we describe a novel post-genomic approach (called Phenogenix ®) that involves the use of complex and random peptide libraries of large size (up to 40 amino acids) and diversity (>10 11independent clones per library) in combination with computational analysis for garnering information on the natural biological partners and pathways [ 7 ] . We also show that the specificity of these peptides can be improved by mutation at the DNA level that has implications for phenotyping and the development of Site Directed Assays.
This non-random association between a surrogate and a target's pharmacologically active site assures a high degree of probability that, once found, surrogates will have utility for the rapid development of SDAs capable of identifying small molecules of pharmacological importance.

This strategy should be very useful for the development of a variety of both in vitro and in vivo applications, including the creation of cell-based expression arrays for proteomics and drug discovery and highly site-specific delivery of transgenes for gene therapy and tissue engineering.

The recent development of intense, photostable and pH-insensitive fluorophores, along with improvements in optical detection systems, has led to fluorophore labeling of many pharmacological agents.
Loss of Fhit protein is among the earliest known events in the development of a variety of the most common and lethal human malignancies [ 1 ] . Loss of Fhit leads to cells that are deficient in programmed cell death and that form tumors in mice while Fhit reexpression in Fhit-cancer cells reduces tumorigenicity and restores programmed cell death [ 2 3 4 5 6 ] . Infection of Fhit +/- mice with viruses that re-express Fhit reduce cancer occurrence [ 7 ] , apparently by killing pre-neoplastic cells that have lost the wild-type Fhit allele.
Not surprisingly, high leaf litter quantity led to larger mass, shorter larval development time and higher survival (Figs.
Our prediction was that B microcosms, with more wall area per unit volume would allow for greater growth and shorter development time of mosquitoes, which it did at low resource levels, possibly by providing more substrate on which periphyton could grow [ 3 ] . In addition, at low litter abundance there is less leaf surface area, and the effects of varying wall surface area will be greater under conditions of limiting resources.
Shorter development time is important in ephemeral aquatic habitats such as temporary ponds and phytotelmata, allowing adults to escape prior to dry down in late spring or early summer [ 29 30 ] . Short time to maturity allows the insects to escape their larval habitat before it dries up, and males that mature before females are ready to mate when females emerge.
The other comparison between B and CW microcosms yielded mosquitoes that were similar in size and development rate.
A final comparison of B to CS microcosms (Table 2) is of interest because it represents a comparison of constant scaling, which encapsulates both horizontal and vertical scaling effects [ 3 ] . Here the major effect is in time to maturity and male biomass, with the smaller volume container producing larger males with shorter development times (Fig.
Growth and survival may thus be affected by habitat size, which varies greatly among small aquatic habitats [ 23 24 31 36 ] . There is a positive relationship between size, or volume, of the habitat and species richness, and between volume and growth responses of individual species [ 16 23 24 25 31 37 ] . Levels of water and resources may be important cues to ovipositing females, with resulting impacts on individuals and communities [ 9 16 38 39 ] . Oviposition site selection is an important variable affecting survival and development of non-dispersing larvae, and large volumes may be preferred by females laying eggs in aquatic environments due to increased stability and decreased risk of drought [ 29 39 ] . However, allochthonous plant material from surrounding terrestrial areas is the major input of energy resources to many freshwater detritus-based food webs, and resource quantity in these habitats is highly heterogeneous and dependent on location of the habitat relative to resource inputs [ 14 40 ] . Clearly, the choice of habitat by ovipositing C pipiens females will have growth and survival consequences for offspring.
Early recognition of the contrast between the stabilizing influences of density-dependent population regulation, and potentially de-stabilizing influences of environmental variation [ 1 ] , laid a foundation for theoretical modeling of population stability in stochastic environments [ 2 ] that assumes renewed relevance in light of current developments in ecology and climate research [ 3 ] . Recently, for instance, numerous studies have documented the influences of global-scale climatic variation on the population dynamics of vertebrates in widely diverse ecosystems (see, e.g., [ 4 5 ] for reviews), including species interactions at the community level [ 6 7 8 ] . To our knowledge, however, no study has yet documented a simultaneous and direct influence of large-scale climate on the dynamics at all trophic levels in a single system.
Based on the approach used in the development of previous bivariate population models [ 12 13 14 ] , we developed and applied a model testing for the direct influence of large-scale climate on the dynamics at individual trophic levels and interactions among levels (Figure 1).
Fungal pathogens can be important selective forces on plants in habitats favorable to fungal development, but estimating the magnitude of selection by fungal pathogens in nature is difficult.
The development of fungal disease in plants has at least three important control points: the prevalence of fungal inoculum, the environment during infection, and disease development as modified by plant defenses [ 1 2 ] . Most field studies on wild plants have not measured pathogen abundance but have focused on disease expression [ 3 4 5 6 ] . Atmospheric moisture is generally the single most important environmental factor influencing the incidence and severity of fungal diseases on plants [ 4 7 8 9 10 ] . High relative humidity and several hours of free surface water are critical for both spore germination and successful infection [ 11 12 13 ] . In addition, infection (i.e.

We have previously reported that it takes from 12-16 h following 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment of Caco-2 cells to first appreciate an increase in saturable transcellular calcium transport [ 19 ] . This temporal response is similar to the 8-16 h observed for the achievement of maximal rates of intestinal calcium absorption in vivo following 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment of vitamin D-deficient chickens [ 28 ] . Future studies of the time course of CaT1 protein expression and localization of this protein to the brush border will be necessary to confirm this point, but must await the development of a suitable CaT1 antibody.
who reported progressive and significant shortening of R-R intervals during neonatal development [ 1].
Evidence to support this view includes the observations of increased levels of norepinephrine in plasma and urine, and decreased norepinephrine content in the iron deficient heart [ 19 20 21 22 ] . Rossi [ 23 ] , after finding that reserpine administration prevented the development of this hypertrophy, even suggested that norepinephrine is the causal agent in the pathology.
However, even in transgenic animal models overexpressing alpha receptors, the beta-adrenergic receptor appears to play an important role in hypertrophy development and the transition to heart failure [ 34 35 ] . Regardless of which receptors are involved in the various forms of hypertrophy, the sympathetic nervous system does appear to play a role in most, if not all, forms of cardiac hypertrophy, and much remains to be done in this area [ 36 ] .
Finally, we hypothesized that a daily injection of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propanolol would significantly reduce the development of ventricular hypertrophy.
Finally, propanolol injections do not prevent the development of iron deficient cardiac hypertrophy, drawing into question the potential causal relationship between beta-adrenergic neurotransmission and this form of hypertrophy.
Nonetheless, examination of several time points during the progression of iron deficiency can potentially provide important insights into the development of resulting physiological alterations.
Many studies have shown that chronic intravenous infusion of norepinephrine is sufficient to cause hypertrophy, and that various forms of hypertrophy are linked to a decrease in either beta-adrenergic receptor density or a decreased responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation [ 46 48 49 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 ] . Barth, for example, showed that norepinephrine infusion induced left ventricular hypertrophy that could be prevented by an adrenergic-receptor blocker [ 58 ] . It has been suggested that ornithine decarboxylase is a link between beta-adrenoreceptors and stimulation of tissue growth factor, which results in hypertrophy [ 64 ] . However, recent studies have focused on alpha-adrenergic reception as a mediator of cardiac hypertrophy [ 35 ] , although some question the role of the alpha-adrenergic receptor as a hypertrophic mediator in vivo [ 34 ] . To date, no published studies of which we are aware have examined alpha-adrenergic reception and the development of cardiac hypertrophy with iron deficiency.
The literature surrounding norepinephrine and its role in the development of iron deficient hypertrophy documents the following facts: 1) prolonged iron deficiency causes cardiac hypertrophy [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 23 ] , 2) the pool of stored norepinephrine in the heart is decreased with iron deficiency [ 17 21 ] , 3) plasma and urine concentrations of norepinephrine are increased with iron deficiency [ 19 20 21 22 68 ] , and 4) chronic administration of reserpine (which depletes norepinephrine) prevents the development of iron deficient hypertrophy [ 12 ] , but not hypertrophy that results from aortic banding [ 23 ] . This, combined with other studies that relate chronic adrenergic stimulation to hypertrophy, led Rossi to the conclusion that iron deficiency hypertrophy was caused by chronic sympathetic stimulation.

However, our finding that a daily injection of the beta-blocker propanolol does not prevent the development of iron deficient cardiac hypertrophy suggests that beta-adrenergic sympathetic stimulation may not be a causal agent in the development of hypertrophy.
However, our finding that a daily injection of the beta-blocker propanolol does not prevent the development of iron deficient cardiac hypertrophy suggests that beta-adrenergic sympathetic stimulation may not be a causal agent in the development of hypertrophy.
The purpose of this study was to investigate cardiac and vascular responses associated with the development of iron deficiency.
The failure of the beta-blocker to prevent hypertrophy suggests that, if the sympathetic nervous system is a causal agent in the development of this form of hypertrophy, the signaling mechanism is not mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor.
The idea that TEA might be a candidate for a lead compound for the development of drugs with possible clinical applications [ 5 ] is supported by the present data that show the effectiveness of TEA in two different mammalian models of AQP1-mediated osmotic water permeability.
In support of the first possibility, we observed a significant force decline in many of the electrically stimulated muscles i.e., some muscles showed a decline in peak tension development of more than 25% by the end of 1 hr. of stimulation.
The hindlimb was fixed so that no movement of the limb was possible during muscle contraction and the Achilles tendon was attached to a force-displacement transducer (Grass Instruments, Co., Quincy, Mass) to monitor tension development during contraction.
Signs of muscle fatigue i.e., a decline in tension development below 75% of peak, were evident using this stimulation protocol after 30-60 minutes in approximately 50% of the rats tested.
There was no detectable difference in VEGF mRNA levels by Northern analysis between muscles that fatigued versus muscles that maintained tension development.
Color development was performed at room temperature overnight in Buffer 2 containing NBT and BCIP (Boehringer Mannheim).
Dissection of medial rings, mounting and determination of the optimum length for stress development at 37°C was performed as described [ 21 ] . The carotid "ring" preparation differs in the method of mounting from our prior heat study which employed carotid "strips" [ 14 ] . The mounting procedure, rings vs. strips does not alter the behavior of the carotid media in tissue baths.
Serum leptin was elevated in mice on the high-fat diet, concordant with the development of obesity, but adrenalectomy had no effect on leptin levels (Table I).
The high fat diet used in this study led to the development of obesity over the course of five weeks as expected (Fig.
Tolerance to a glucose load was also impaired in mice after one week on the high-fat diet, suggesting the development of insulin resistance (Fig.
Diet-induced obesity led to significant increases in body weight and adiposity and to the development of glucose intolerance.
This hypothesis is particularly compelling since recent data suggest that aberrant glucocorticoid activity may play a key role in the development of the metabolic syndrome [ 10 ] .
After more chronic exposure, this delicate balance could plausibly become disrupted, leading to glucocorticoid-mediated development of the metabolic syndrome [ 10 ] . Thus interactions between insulin, leptin, and glucocorticoids, and the neuropeptide responses they generate within the melanocortin system, allow complex metabolic responses to nutritional status but may also allow the development of metabolic pathologies.

Loss of myocytes is thought to contribute to the progressivedecline in left ventricular function and the development of congestiveheart failure.
Both in animal and human studies of heart failure, β-adrenergicblockade intervention appears to have beneficial effects on cardiacmyocyte function [ 1 23 24 ] . Of particularimportance, studies using carvedilol have shown remarkable improvementsin cardiac performance [ 12 13 15 16 ] andreduction in mortality in humans [ 17 ] .We have previously shown that propranolol, a nonselective β-blocker,is cardioprotective and prevents the development of heart failurein turkeys when given concurrently with furazolidone [ 21 ] . Similarly, carteolol, a nonselective β-blocker,resulted in improvement in ejection fraction, reduction in ventricularvolumes, an increase in developed pressure as well as an increasein rate of survival in our turkey model [ 18 ] . Improvementin cardiac function was associated with cellular remodeling of cardiacmyocytes.
Loss of cardiacmyocytes has been suspected to be a feature of the cardiomyopathicprocess that contributes to progressive decline in left ventricularfunction and the development of congestive heart failure [ 29 ] . Evidence supporting the concept ofmyocyte apoptosis occurrence and contribution in the progressionof heart failure has been obtained from a variety of observations,including in vitro studies, experimental animal modelsof cardiac dysfunction, and studies on cardiac tissue obtainedfrom patients with end-stage heart failure [ 5 7 8 9 29 ] .
The development of animal models of heart failure in which apoptosisis an important feature will allow the modulation of cell deathpathways through targeted interventions.
The apoptotic processis linked to the development and progression of heart failure aswell as the improvement in cardiac function seen with β-blockade.
The development of both types of ligands could therefore have important biomedical implications.
One of these ligands displays original structural and chemical characteristics, which could be used in the development of novel compounds for cancer prevention and therapy.
It will be interesting to test these molecules for anti-proliferative activity, both in vitro and in vivo . The observation that agonist 1 does not belong to any of the series of RAR ligands described so far makes this compound particularly interesting for further development.
In recent years, it has become clear that the neuronal nAChR is a valid target against a variety of diseases, including cognitive and attention deficits, Parkinson's disease, anxiety, and pain management [ 3 4 ] ; the addiction liability and other undesirable side-effects of nicotine prohibit the use of this natural product for therapeutic applications, but the active development of nAChR agonists presenting adequate receptor subtype specificity should result in improved pharmacology and potency [ 4 ] . As for most membrane proteins, information on the 3 dimensional structure of the nAChR is limited, and the best experimental structure consists of 4.6 A data from electron microscopy [ 5 ] , a resolution that does not allow for structure-based design approaches.
Previous reports have shown on other systems that a single-residue mutation in a receptor is sufficient for the development of specific ligands [ 13 14 ] . Based on the recent crystal structure of AChBP, we could propose a detailed description of the structural variations of nAChR subtypes.
Identification of T-cell epitopes associated with a particular disease can lead to the development of potential peptide vaccines.
Development of an efficient energy function for the accurate prediction of both backbone and side-chain conformations followed by an effective MHC-peptide interaction function will help to quantify the differences in peptide binding caused by MHC polymorphism and peptide diversity.
Even though structure prediction methods need further development, it is possible to produce models where functional hypotheses can be tested in a rational manner (for example, with mutagenesis experiments) through detailed analysis [ 54 ] . Additionally, structure comparisons can be used to detect functional relationships that cannot be detected by sequence information alone [ 52 ] , and micro-environment analyses that parse models for particular three-dimensional motifs [ 55 ] can be used to discern molecular function.
Developments in our ab initio sampling protocol were incorporated into our loop sampling technique.
RS performed the algorithm development, carried out the computations, evaluated the results, and drafted the manuscript.
ML helped with the algorithm development and evaluation of the results produced, and provided intellectual guidance and mentorship.
For the development of an all-encompassing potential energy function for the protein folding problem that can simulate both the thermodynamic and kinetic processes, it is argued that one must start from first principles [ 1 ] . However, given the complexity of the problem, involving thousands of atoms and an extremely large number of conformations available to these atoms, the available computational power posses a serious restriction.
Another crucial requirement for the development of potential functions using optimization-based methods is the generation of realistic and challenging decoys.
Development of the concept was done by all the three authors.
The present study was undertaken for the following reasons: 1) to assess long-term changes in tinnitus severity exhibited by patients who completed a comprehensive tinnitus management program; 2) to identify factors that contributed to changes in tinnitus severity within this population; 3) to contribute to the development and refinement of effective assessment and management procedures for tinnitus.
Variables with p < 0.10 in univariate analysis for a relationship with development of hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis were entered into multivariate analysis as covariates.
DT indicates a combination of delay in seeking therapy and faster development of new cavities.
To increase physician knowledge of new developments in palliation and their level of clinical competence in end-of-life care, the Institute for Ethics at the American Medical Association, with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, embarked on the Education for Physicians on End-of-life Care (EPEC) Project.
A key tool of the EPEC Project was the development of the EPEC Curriculum.
Physical dependence, evidenced by the development of a withdrawal syndrome when a medication is suddenly withdrawn, is not evidence of addition [ 30 ] . Similar outcomes occur in the presence of exogenous hormones and other medications that act through cellular receptors (eg, estrogens, beta-blockers, alpha-2 agonists, caffeine, etc.).
Referring physicians made the diagnosis of premature ovarian failure based on the following criteria: development of at least 4 months of amenorrhea before age 40 associated with two serum FSH levels above 40 IU/L (drawn at least 1 month apart).
Primordial germs cells originate from a small number of progenitor cells that arise in very early development.
Such therapy could have serious consequences, such as the development of osteonecrosis [ 4 ]
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Institutional Review Board approved the protocol.
This approach can have severe adverse consequences such as the development of osteonecrosis related to glucocorticoid therapy [ 4 ] . Here we demonstrate that detection of ovarian antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence using one specific commercial test system has poor specificity as a diagnostic test.
The complete absence of a corpus callosum in rats exposed in utero to EtOH has been documented by several studies [ 7 8 9 ] . Because in utero exposure to EtOH affects both corpus callosum development and laterality, researchers have turned to the rat model to assess the impact of EtOH on both measures.
The genu, body, and splenium were identified to confirm complete development of the corpus callosum.
A priori contrasts were conducted to determine if differences existed between groups on all dependent measures (laterality, corpus callosum [development and weight], splenium development, total brain weight, and pup weight gain).
A priori contrasts were conducted to determine if differences existed between groups on all dependent measures (laterality, corpus callosum [development and weight], splenium development, total brain weight, and pup weight gain).
As an indication of EtOH and SY fetal effects the CC weight measure does not seem to provide much relevant information, whereas the measure of splenium development clearly indicates EtOH-induced disruption.
The in utero effect of EtOH on splenium development has also been observed in humans with FAS.
Further evidence of laterality disruption was manifested by incomplete splenium development in 8 of the 10 EtOH-exposed rats.
Because callosal development was complete in rats exposed to the co-administration of SY with EtOH, it appears that SY conferred some ameliorative effects upon the corpus callosum developmental process.
Without the SY, EtOH-exposed pups clearly displayed EtOH-induced disruption to normal callosal development.
This review is unique a) by the cooperative work among a multidisciplinary team of researchers and content-experts; b) the review was not limited to any specific discipline or language; c) the focus on content validity is practical and clinically relevant to practitioners and researchers; d) a great effort and detail went into the development of the search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality-scoring instrument.
All listed authors worked collectively on the design of the study and development of the review instruments.

The purpose of MeSH is to provide uniformity and consistency to the indexing of the biomedical literature [ 3 ] . With the recent development of CAM on PubMed [ 4 5 ] , MeSH descriptors for CAM have been expanded.
The levator ani muscles play an important role in bladder neck fixation provided by the suspensory sling and hiatal ligament [ 6 ] . The urethra is supported by the action of the levator ani muscles through their connection to the endopelvic fascia of the anterior vaginal wall [ 7 ] , and the muscles of the levator ani contract during a cough to assist continence [ 8 ] . The fast twitch type II fibers in the levator ani muscles play an important role in continence, and their loss accompanies the development of urinary incontinence [ 9 ] . Clinically, women with recurrent urinary incontinence after Burch colposuspension have a more pronounced pelvic floor weakness than women with primary stress urinary incontinence [ 10 ] . This suggests that the recurrent urinary incontinence is caused by a progression of pelvic floor dysfunction.
After development and film exposure, the membrane was washed and stained for actin (0.
The philosophy behind the use and development of PKQuest differs from that of the standard PBPK applications.
Because of developments in the Internet, we converted access to all resources to the Internet via the public address, http://Clinical.UTHSCSA.edu.
Further research and development of more efficient strategies for seeking medical evidence are needed.

The alpha coefficient is especially useful during test development because it gives a measure of how each item is contributing to the scale to which it has been assigned.
Physical diagnosis skills examined in the present study correlated with scores on the USMLE Step 1 exam, and the skills that foreshadow the clinical clerkships - identification of abnormality and development of differential diagnoses - best predicted USMLE scores [ 42 ] .
This, in turn, has led telemedicine advocates to blame payors for impeding development of the technology.
Another bill, the Health Information and Quality Improvement Act of 2001, would provide $420 million to help hospitals develop and use information technology that can reduce the frequency of medical errors [ 51 ] . However such support would not be sufficiently broad-based, and would not substitute for development of a National Health Information Infrastructure.
To be effective, development and implementation of new information technologies must speak to the minute-to-minute needs of all types of providers.
If it is to occur, substantial investment will be needed to galvanize this change, probably in large part from the federal government, with development of a national health information infrastructure representing the most important piece of the puzzle.
The TMA Data Exchange Specification provides software programmers with a promising new area for development.
During carcinogenesis, morphologically identifiable lesions occur that precede the development of invasive cancer.
3. The different kinds of precancers may vary in every biologic feature except those specified in their definition (identifiable lesions that precede the development of cancer).
They are identifiable lesions that can precede the development of cancer.
Financial, ownership and utilization data were obtained from the Hospital Annual Financial Disclosure Reports, filed annually by all California hospitals with the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD).

After the completion of this research, Dr. Michael Pignone has received licensing and consulting fees from Bayer, Inc. for the development of a CHD risk estimation tool.
Ideal circumstances would allow for the development of cost estimates based on a comprehensive study, designed not to influence resource use, of unselected patients with sufficient follow-up.
This finding is in line with the literature, which suggests that individuals who have cognitive deficits are at greater risk for exhibiting behavioral problems in long-term and other non-acute settings [ 24 ] . Investigators have found lower MMSE scores at admission predictive of functional decline following acute medical illness and hospitalization [ 26 ] . Additionally, cognitive impairment is associated with the development of delirium during hospitalization, which in turn, can result in a variety of behavioral problems [ 27 ] . However, in these studies, patients usually had cognitive impairment indicative of dementia, whereas the current study suggests that among hospitalized elderly, a MMSE score of less than 27 places a patient at increased risk of behavioral problems.
Although we identified predictors that could be easily obtained or assessed at admission, other variables, including diagnosis, acuity of illness, co-morbidities, pain, and type and dose of medications, may also be associated with the development of behavioral problems in this setting.
In summary, we report on the development of an inducible mammalian cell expression system for the catalytic subunit of the α-isotype for PP1.
These findings, provided by the development of this inducible PP1 expression system, will afford new research opportunities aimed towards addressing the question of how PP1 activity is regulated.
Vitamin E was established as an essential micronutrient for proper fetal development [ 1 ] and the amount of vitamin E required to maintain proper fetal development has been defined in International Units.

In an unrelated study, we investigated the effects of mefloquine on global transcription in rat neuroblastoma (NG108) cells using microarrays [ 7 ] . Mefloquine caused a striking upregulation of growth arrest and development protein 153 (GADD153), a transcription factor selectively modulated under conditions of ER stress [ 8 ] . Taken together, these observations suggest that mefloquine might perturb the function of the ER via a disruption of calcium homeostasis.
Plates were read on a Uvmax plate reader at 405 nm (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) after 1 hr development with substrate.
Serologic tools for assessment of exposure to the parasite are still under development and testing.
The metabolic syndrome is a condition that promotes atherosclerosis and increases the risk of cardiovascular events [ 1 2 3 ] . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 47 million Americans, or about one in five people, have this condition [ 1 ] . Contributors to the development of the metabolic syndrome may include genetics, a sedentary lifestyle, a Western diet (high in refined carbohydrates, low in fiber, and high in saturated fat), cigarette smoking, and progressive weight gain [ 2 ] . The characteristics of the metabolic syndrome include atherogenic dyslipidemia, a prothrombotic state, insulin resistance, hypertension, and abdominal obesity [ 3 4 ] . Each abnormality promotes atherosclerosis independently, but when clustered together, these metabolic disorders are increasingly atherogenic and enhance the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [ 1 ] . Based on observational studies there is evidence to support that several factors related to lifestyle habits may influence cardiovascular risk [ 5 6 7 ] . Among these factors the beneficial effect of several dietary patterns on human health, have already been underlined [ 8 9 10 ] . One of these diets, the Mediterranean diet, has received much attention during the past decades.
Although the benefits from the adoption of this diet on all cause survival have long been recognized, little is known about its association with the development of acute coronary events, in people with the metabolic syndrome.
In this work we evaluated the effect of the adoption of Mediterranean diet on the development of acute coronary syndromes, in subject with the metabolic syndrome.
The hedgehog ( hh ) gene was identified two decades ago in Drosophila as a critical regulator of cell-fate determination during embryogenesis [ 1 ] . Subsequent work in several model systems has defined and characterized the Hh gene family that encodes highly conserved secreted signaling proteins (for review see [ 2 ] ). Hedgehog (Hh) proteins are synthesized as approximately 45 kDa precursors that autoprocess in an unprecedented fashion, resulting in the covalent attachment of a cholesterol moiety to the amino-terminal half of the precursor [ 2 ] . This processed amino-terminal domain, Hh-Np, is responsible for the activation of a unique and complex signaling cascade that is essential for controlling cell fate throughout development and into adulthood [ 2 ] . In mammals there are three Hh-family proteins: Sonic (Shh), Indian (Ihh), and Desert (Dhh).
Gene-targeting experiments in mice have demonstrated that the development and patterning of essentially every major organ requires input from the Hh pathway [ 2 ] .
5) when the midline defects are first detectable in both Shh -/-and Smo -/-embryos, but prior to any general retardation of growth and development [ 26 27 ] . In both Shh +/-and Smo +/- Ptc1 lacZ /+embryos, Ptc1 was detected in ventral neural tube, somites and lateral plate mesoderm (Figure 3e,i,m).

TN contributed image analysis and software expertise in method development.
IB and CCWK provided clinical expertise in method development, selected the clinical slides for testing the method and made independent drusen measurements by stereo pair grading for method validation.
We are hypothesizing that MMG can indicate the degree of muscle activation and therefore can be used to monitor the development of the muscle fatigue, in the same way the SEMG has been proved to do.
That is why the MMG is as valuable as SEMG in exploring not only peripheral fatigue, but also sensorimotor interaction and central intervention in the development of the muscular fatigue.
It brings additional evidence on the central fatigue and provides means of quantifying the fatigue development in the isometric exercise.
According to this study, the MMG signal can be used for indication of the degree of muscle activation and for monitoring the muscle fatigue development in the isometric contraction.
The rec12 mutants were proficient at meiosis and underwent two meiotic divisions as revealed by ascus development and the distribution of chromosomes.
However, each of the rec12 mutants exhibited a high frequency of chromosome segregation errors that were sometimes accompanied by defects in spore formation and/or ascus development (Figure 3B).
Funded primarily by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), DHS is administered by Macro International Inc. [ 20 ] . Low-income country governments and international organizations have long relied on DHS data to monitor a variety of child and maternal health and family planning indicators [ 21 ] . One of the most significant contributions of the DHS is the collection of internationally comparable data on the demographic and health characteristics of populations in developing countries [ 22 23 24 25 ] ..
JIL drafted the manuscript and assisted in the development of the analytical model; YN developed the model to estimate health benefits from energy savings; and JDS conceived of the original study and participated in design and coordination.
Both sources vary in terms of the validity and reliability of information on maternal pre- and gravid disease and pregnancy complications and require cautious interpretation of findings [ 25 26 27 ] . We believe that this has hampered a more complete interpretation of findings regarding the hazards of fish consumption on fetal development.
One frequently cited study reporting a negative association with Great Lakes fish consumption and birth size did not appear to include cigarette smoking in the model [ 4 ] as noted by at least one other author [ 42 ] . A few authors have noted that the fish consumption effect, despite being negatively associated with birth size, is small in comparison to other covariates important for fetal growth and development [ 12 24 ] , which is more in keeping with our findings.
Excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics in hospitals, health care facilities and the community contributes to the development of bacterial resistance.
Selective pressure by antimicrobial drugs is by far the most important driving force for the development of such resistance.
It is preferable to keep the number of drugs per prescription as low as possible to minimize the risk of drug interactions, development of bacterial resistance and hospital costs [ 15 ] . We did not look at the co-prescribed drugs here, but concentrated only on antibiotics.
Prevention and control of the spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms will require increased adherence to basic infection control policies and procedures, incorporation of antimicrobial resistance strategies into institutional goals and development of a plan to deal with patients colonized with resistant organisms [ 23 ] .
Because of the latency in the development of cancer, it would not even be plausible to say that the 1996 data could explain only 1997 diagnoses.
Also, the ZIP code of residence at diagnosis is an inadequate descriptor of an individual's location during the development of cancer.
However, the precise mechanism of each of these genetic alterations in the multi-step pathway of cervical tumor development is largely unknown.
The development of CC is preceded by distinct morphological changes from normal epithelium to carcinoma through low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs).
Thus, deletions at 5p identified in high-grade CINs suggest that these genetic alterations occur prior to development of invasive carcinoma.
3 that harbor putative TSGs important in CC development providing a basis for their identification.
Based on the follow-up studies, we suggested that 5p genetic deletions might identify high-risk lesions for progression to invasive cancer [ 7 ] . In a more recent study it was also shown that the 5p deletions were significantly more frequent in dysplasias that were recurrent compared to non-recurrent dysplasias [ 9 ] . These data therefore suggest that 5p genetic alterations occur early in cervical carcinogenesis and they may be critical to the development of invasive cancer.
In addition, we have shown that the genetic deletions on 5p occur early during the development of CC in high-grade CIN lesions.
In addition to producing energy, mitochondria are involved in intermediary metabolism, ion homeostasis, synthesis of lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides, active transport processes, cell motility, and cell proliferation [ 1 2 3 4 ] . Recent developments also demonstrate that mitochondria are key regulators of programmed cell death [ 4 ] . Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the most profound features of cancer cells.
Among genes that are up regulated in Rho 0cells p19 (INK4d), a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, is focally expressed during fetal development and plays a role in terminal differentiation [ 19 ] . Members of the group of INK proteins are involved in arresting cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle.
Another interesting feature in the expression profile of cells lacking mtDNA is the low expression of many genes that play a role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system [ 47 48 ] . Of particular interest is the gene that encodes neurotensin receptor I, a short peptide receptor for neurotensin that exerts neuromodulatory functions in the central nervous system and endocrine/paracrine actions in the periphery [ 49 ] . Neuromodulin is also involved in the growth and regeneration of axons, and in the elongation of axons as an axonal transport membrane protein [ 45 ] . Synuclein is expressed in the nervous tissues and mutations in this gene are associated with rare familial cases of early-onset Parkinson's disease [ 50 ] . Gamma synuclein is also involved in tumorigenesis [ 42 ] . PKC-g mutation has been shown to lead to neurodegeneration [ 51 ] . Dachshund, a putative transcription factor, plays a role in retinal development [ 52 ] . Huntingtin-interacting protein-2 is involved in the neurodegenerative Huntington disease [ 53 ] .

Promoter methylation has been well recognized as an important epigenetic change in the development of cancer [ 1 ] . Normally, CpG islands in the promoter regions of a number of genes are present in an unmethylated state [ 2 ] . Aberrant methylation of CpG islands in promoters is characteristic of several genes in cancer leading to loss of gene expression.
A unique feature of GCTs is their origin from germ cells at a stage in development where they undergo epigenetic reprogramming [ 6 13 ] . The absence of this epigenetic modification in SGCTs is consistent with their GC-like nature as previously noted [ 6 14 ] . On the other hand, the extensive promoter hypermethylation seen in NSGCTs suggests a mechanistic role in their potential for embryonal and extra-embryonal lineage differentiation [ 6 14 ] . Establishment of DNA methylation in the mammalian genome is controlled by at least three DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), DNMT1 , DNMT3a and DNMT3b [ 15 ] . The role of these DNMTs in differential de novo methylation in SGCT vs.
Pax3 gene encodes a transcriptional factor important in early development program, while FKHR gene encodes another generic transcriptional factor that is widely expressed in mammalian tissues.
Ese-1/Esx is a member of the Ets transcription factor family and is expressed mainly in epithelial tissue [ 30 ] . Its expression has been detected during mammary gland development and breast tumorigenesis [ 47 48 ] . It is noteworthy that Ese-1/Esx is a potential transcriptional regulator of the TGFβ type II receptor [ 31 ] and overexpression of Ese-1/Esx in non-invasive cells leads to a reduction in cell growth in the presence of TGFβ, presumably because of an increased TGFβ type II receptor level [ 49 ] . It is interesting that TGFβ-dependent downregulation of Ese-1/Esx is not affected by SB-203580.
Converging evidence from epidemiological and molecular studies suggests that infection of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is causally linked to the development of CC [ 4 ] . Since only a small fraction of HPV-infected cervical intra-epithelial neoplastic (CIN) lesions progress to invasive cancer, these studies further suggest that in addition to HPV, other host genetic factors play a role in cervical carcinogenesis [ 5 ] . A number of molecular studies have identified genetic alterations in these two histologic types of CC and at various stages of precursor lesions [ 6 7 8 ] . Despite this molecular characterization, the genetic basis of CC initiation and progression is still very poorly understood.
Epigenetic hypermethylation in the promoter regions of a number of genes has been recognized as an important change in the development of human cancer [ 9 ] . A growing number of cancer-related genes have been identified to harbor methylation of cytosine residues in CpG-rich promoter sequences.
7%) showed absent or reduced expression suggesting that CDH1 inactivation is a later event in CC development.
If confirmed, the down-regulated RARB expression in high-grade CINs suggests that this occurs early in progression and plays a role in the development of CC.
Genetic alterations play an important role in the development of CC [ 4 7 8 ] . Our extensive molecular analyses identified a number of specific genetic changes in invasive CC and its precursor lesions [ 6 14 15 16 17 18 19 ] . However, epigenetic alteration in cervical tumorigenesis is not well characterized [ 12 13 ] . In the present study, we identified an overall methylation in 87.
Therefore, these data indicate that the methylation of CDH1 gene is a late event in the development of CC.
These results support the tumor suppressor role of HIC1 and its inactivation by promoter methylation in CC may be a critical epigenetic change in tumor development.
Association of APC promoter methylation with MSI phonotype has been previously reported in endometrial cancer [ 45 ] . Although the significance of these results is currently unclear, we believe that inactivation of these genes by promoter methylation causes microsatellite instability and may contribute to the development of CC.
Thus, our data also suggest that epigenetic changes that accompany methylation are common in CC and play critical role in CC development.
This knowledge of epigenetic changes in CC may have implications in our understanding of the role they play in CC development.
The transcription factor NF-κB plays a critical role in controlling expression of downstream target genes in immune and inflammatory responses, development, and apoptosis [ 30 ] . Important advances have been made in understanding the signal transduction cascades that control NF-κB activation.
Studies have yet to resolve all the mechanisms of action of LC-PUFA, in particular the remarkable phenotypic differences between populations that consume different quantities of fish and fish oil in their diets [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] . Dietary LC-PUFA affect processes including: growth, neurological development, lean and fat mass accretion, reproduction, innate and acquired immunity, infectious pathologies of viruses, bacteria and parasites; and the incidence and severity of virtually all chronic and degenerative diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis, stroke, arthritis, diabetes, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and skin diseases [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 ] . Due to lack of mechanistic knowledge, predictions for optimal intake of nutritionally important LC-PUFA remain vague and dietary recommendations simply relate to prevention of overt deficiency.
This has been associated with selective retention and/or elimination of synapses that are transiently overproduced during memory consolidation [ 89 ] . In rat hippocampus, during development, PKCδ can negatively regulate polysialyltransferase activity and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) polysialylation state [ 89 ] . NCAM is implicated in neural differentiation and cellular plasticity [ 90 ] . Our observed decrease in Prkcd expression may have affected hippocampal polysialyltransferase activity.
Lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities play a major role in the development and progression of coronary artery disease.
However, the development of DNA microarray technology, which allows rapid interrogation of thousands of genes and the detection of gene expression at frequencies even less than 1 in 100,000, has now greatly facilitated such experimentation [ 32 33 ] . This communication represents our initial efforts to use DNA microarrays in a reductionist approach to begin to identify the genes expressed as a consequence of triggering each individual ligand during lymphocyte activation.
Several signaling events, including the activation of Jak kinases 1 and 3 are shared among the 'common γ chain' cytokines [ 50 ] . Other signaling events, such as the activation of Shc, Gab2, SHP-2 and MAPK, are shared among IL-2 and 15, but not the other common γ chain cytokine receptors, and Tyr 388 of IL-2Rβ appears critical for these events [ 51 ] . Despite these signaling similarities, it is clear that the biological properties of IL-2 are unique among the common γ chain cytokines, as the other cytokines cannot compensate for IL-2 in the IL-2 knockout mouse [ 52 ] . In addition, IL-15 appears uniquely critical for the development of NK cells, as evidenced by the phenotypes of IL-15 [ 53 ] and IL-15R α [ 54 ] deficient mice.
Current clinical guidelines [ 5 ] call for persons infected with HIV to take a combination of antiretroviral medications to decrease viral load, maintain immune cell function, and prevent the development of resistant viral strains.
New developments in the treatment of HIV have produced dramatic improvements in the clinical and immunologic health for many patients, with a resulting reduction in deaths due to AIDS in the United States.
Estrogenic steroids regulate cellular function in a wide variety of tissues [ 1 ] . During human pregnancy, the production of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) rises eighty fold, from 0.75 nM preovulatory peak to 60 nM at term [ 2 3 4 5 ] , and estrogens influence various aspects of placental function and fetal development in humans and primates [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ] . Several previous studies have shown that human placenta binds estradiol [ 13 14 15 ] . However, more recent immunohistochemical studies on paraffin-embedded or snap frozen sections as well as other techniques (RT-PCR for ER-alpha mRNA) failed to demonstrate estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in human placentae during pregnancy or in cultures of dispersed placental cells [ 16 17 ] . However, it has been indicated that the failure to detect the ERα does not entirely preclude the presence of this receptor in human trophoblast cells, but might be attributed to a relatively low number and density of ERα molecules on these cells [ 17 ] . On the other hand, Billiar et al.
For the purpose of statistical analysis in this study, the PT1 and PT2 placentae were coupled, since they can be considered as normal placentae capable of responding and fulfilling the demands of the growing fetus by compensatory villous development or expansion of existing mature villi [ 30 ] . They were compared with placental types showing moderate and severe abnormality (coupled PT3 and PT4).
This correlated with poor development of syncytial aggregates.
Yet, ERα at mid-pregnancy levels further stimulated syncytium development, as evidenced by the development of extremely large syncytial aggregates in late cultures from normal placentae, and development of large syncytial aggregates in cultures from abnormal placentae.

Yet, ERα at mid-pregnancy levels further stimulated syncytium development, as evidenced by the development of extremely large syncytial aggregates in late cultures from normal placentae, and development of large syncytial aggregates in cultures from abnormal placentae.
However, it is important to note that pharmacological levels of E2 (200 nM) have been found to suppress development of syncytial aggregates even in cultures derived from normal placentae (unpublished data).
The rate of reproductive development and the onset of fertility are influenced by an array of environmental factors that can be broadly grouped as physical, nutritional, and social [ 1 ] . Chief among social cues in mammals are priming pheromones that can retard or accelerate sexual development within constraints of factors such as photoperiod and nutritional status of the individual.

Chief among social cues in mammals are priming pheromones that can retard or accelerate sexual development within constraints of factors such as photoperiod and nutritional status of the individual.
The 90 day old group provided baseline data for assessment of development in both unexposed and exposed animals.
This study demonstrates that exposure of juvenile females to pheromone from a single source, the male suprasternal gland, accelerates ovarian follicular development and first estrus.
As in the majority of mammalian species, successful embryonic development in the pig requires temporally and spatially specific gene expression essential to placental and embryonic differentiation during early gestation.
Expressing the appropriate transcripts during development of the pig conceptus is essential for expansion of the trophoblast and placental attachment to the uterine surface.
Prenatal mortality in the pig ranges from 20% to 46% by term [ 1 ] , the majority of which occurs during peri-implantation conceptus development [ 2 ] . The peri-implantation period is the most critical stage of conceptus development as a rapid morphological transformation of the trophoblast occurs just prior to conceptus attachment to the uterine surface [ 3 ] . Rapid transformation of the trophoblast, termed trophoblastic elongation, occurs during days 11 to 12 of gestation.

It has been estimated that approximately 10,000 genes must be appropriately expressed for successful pre-implantation and early fetal development [ 7 ] . A number of mRNAs hypothesized to be involved with early porcine conceptus development have been evaluated.

[ 8 ] characterized gene expression for retinoic acid receptors (RAR) α, β and γ as well as retinal binding proteins (RBP) during early porcine conceptus development and trophoblast elongation.
Due to the limited time frame when conceptuses are in tubular transitional development (2-3 hrs) and difficulty in determining when tubular conceptuses are in the uterus following mating, one uterine horn was removed on day 11.
However, given that gilt, as a random effect, did not significantly alter the variation due to the model and not all gilts were represented across all stages of development, gilt was deleted from the model.
During early porcine development a rapid morphological transformation of the conceptus from a spherical (9-10 mm) to filamentous (> 150 mm) morphology is required to establish adequate placenta to uterine contact necessary for survival [ 2 ] . Characterization of the specific subset of genes regulating peri-implantation conceptus development and trophoblastic elongation in the pig provides valuable information concerning key developmental events essential to embryonic survival after trophoblastic elongation [ 1 ] .

Previous information regarding genes critical to development in early pig pregnancy is limited.
However, MPS-1 gene expression needs to be quantitatively analyzed across the stages of conceptus development.
Given the substantial increase in gene expression and temporal relationship to conceptus development, OSU-T1-50 may play an important role in trophoblastic elongation.
Future studies will attempt to identify the gene and its translated protein to determine the biological function during conceptus development.
SAHH may have significant impact on the conceptuses ability to use folates during this transitional stage of development.
Addition of an inhibitor to SAHH, 3-deazaaristeromycin, inhibits inner cell mass proliferation and differentiation during in vitro development of non-mutant embryos [ 28 ] .
As in other species, SAHH is likely a biological regulator of the SAM/SAH ratio controlling the occurrence of transmethylation reactions to the degree of which they are necessary for successful porcine conceptus development.
Advanced conceptuses, those that elongate first, have a much greater advantage with regards to acquiring ample placental:uterine contact and also limit the available uterine capacity for those conceptuses lagging in development [ 2 ] . While gene expression for SAHH was present at all stages evaluated, an approximate 7-fold increase in relative expression for this transcript over a 2-3 hour time period is noteworthy.
Increased SAHH expression by advanced conceptuses suggests there would also be increased homocysteine released into the uterine lumen that may have an embryo-toxic effect on neighboring conceptuses lagging in development.
Gene expression changes for HSC70 during early development have previously been associated with neurulation in Xenopus [ 29 ] and chick [ 30 ] embryos.
Negative mutations of HSC70 in the nervous system of Drosophila larvae resulted in both developmental defects and lethality [ 31 ] . The increased HSC70 gene expression during trophoblastic elongation is temporally associated with neural tube development in pig conceptuses.
The egg is a transcriptionally inactive cell and as such is a storehouse of maternal proteins and mRNA required for fertilization and the initiation of zygotic development.
HSP70 is one of the first genes to be expressed following zygotic gene activation in the two-cell mouse embryo [ 38 39 40 ] and appears to play a role in developmental processes in a number of species [ 50 51 52 53 ] . Endogenous HSP90 has also been implicated in developmental regulation in the mouse [ 52 ] , and GRP78 is described as having a stress-response function during avian development [ 54 ] . Activation of the zygotic genome initiates an accumulation of embryonic transcripts in the early two-cell embryo, and this likely requires machinery to ensure the accurate translation and folding of nascent proteins.
During development, selective cell death by apoptosis becomes crucial, and chaperone molecules in the egg may play a role in later apoptotic events.
Voltage-gated K +channels in non-nerve, non-muscle cells play crucial roles in cell development, proliferation, migration, volume regulation, as well as maintenance of membrane potential and cell viability.
Table 1lists the classical and non-classical estrogen sensitive tissues and cells [ 1 ] . Although several previous studies have shown that human placenta binds estradiol (E2) [ 2 3 4 ] , and estrogens influence various aspects of placental function and fetal development in humans and primates [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ] , the placenta as a target for estrogens is missing.
A recent study of βERKO mice has shown that ERβ is not required for the normal prepubertal development of the mammary gland but for organization and adhesion of epithelial cells during pregnancy and hence for differentiated tissue morphology [ 23 ] . These observations indicate a possibility of complementary (sequential) roles of ERα and ERβ, since ERα appears to be required for the basic development of estrogen sensitive tissues and ERβ seems to be required for their functional maturation.

Development of mature ST aggregates (m, panel C) was associated with gradual diminution of nuclear staining (solid > white arrows), but persisting cytoplasmic ERβ immunoreactivity.
We recently showed that exogenous E2 markedly stimulates development of large syncytial aggregates in trophoblast cultures [ 15 ] . We also observed that this effect can be abolished with pure anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 (unpublished data).
Other LIF effects that may influence the stress response through actions in the rodent nervous system are a LIF induced increase in acetylcholine [ 20 ] and LIF induced decreases in neuropeptide Y and tyrosine hydroxylase [ 21 ] . LIFR:gp130 signaling has strong effects in systems peripheral to but influenced by the HPA including reproductive, skeletal, nervous, neuromuscular, cardiovascular, hematopoietic, immune and metabolic systems, with influences on both development and adult homeostasis [for reviews see [ 7 22 23 24 25 26 27 ] ].
This study explores the effect of alteration of the GC environment during late gestation, with the expectation that suppression of GC effects will improve the LIFR null newborn phenotype and identify LIFR as an obligatory player in concert with the maternal GC surge during late gestation development.
RU486 administration during late gestation results in improved development of bone, skeletal muscle, and glial cells in LIFR null fetuses.
Within litter Lifr +/+ and +/- pups served as controls since there has been no detectable gene dose effect between Lifr +/+ and +/- at this stage of development.
Thus, the impact of maternal adrenalectomy on the fetuses appeared to have a selective negative effect on the development of the Lifr -/- pups.
Ordinarily very few GFAP positive cells are seen at this stage of development in wild type animals, making detection of GFAP positive cells dependent on particular spinal cord section viewed.
Lung development in all the pups looked normal as viewed on H&E stained thin sections.
Maternal adrenalectomy worsens the osteopenia, while maternal hormone suppression through RU486 improves the presumed GC related phenotypes: osteopenia, skeletal muscle integrity and glial development.
The survival of Lifr -/- pups following RU486 treatment was similar to the phenotype seen in CNTFR null mice where neuronal development was disrupted which disallowed suckling [ 40 ] . This indicates that at least some of the problems encountered with neuronal development that affect normal suckling were not ameliorated by RU486.

This indicates that at least some of the problems encountered with neuronal development that affect normal suckling were not ameliorated by RU486.
Excess GC activity due to LIFR loss is an unexpected result since LIF gain-of-function mice develop a Cushing's-like syndrome [ 29 30 ] . Thus, if the relationship were simple, loss of LIFR function would predict development of GC insufficiency.
A primary function of this surge is to allow development to switch from growth to maturation of a number of systems that will allow the pup to survive on separation from the mother.
In addition, the maternal GC surge effectively leads to fetal glycogen accumulation in the liver for energy demands at birth, increased fetal bioavailable tri-iodothyronine from thyroxine to allow for an increased metabolic rate and thermogenesis required at birth, maturation of the fetal small gut to prepare for digestion, heightened fetal adrenal medullar catecholamine release for control of the above processes, maturation of fetal kidney function and a switch to bone marrow hematopoiesis from the fetal liver [reviewed by [ 41 ] ]. The timing of this maternal surge suggests that LIFR function is required at this point in development as a moderator of the consequences of excess GC level.
In addition, a progesterone receptor knockout mouse model affects only female mice with reported effects limited to organs of reproduction causing anovulation, uterine hyperplasia and inflammation, limited mammary development and impaired sexual behavior [ 58 ] . There was no noticeable difference in phenotype in the Lifr -/- pups due to gender following any of the treatments (data not shown).
5 [ 61 ] . This suggests that the effect of gp130 knockout on cardiac development is mediated outside of cardiac tissue and the primary developmental defect is peripheral to the heart.
Given the improvement in skeletal muscle noted in this study following RU486, it would be reasonable to explore a central HPA defect following gp130 loss as the mediator of hypotrophic cardiac development.
LIF and CNTF stimulate muscle regeneration in vivo [ 62 63 ] , as do other growth factors; such as insulin-like growth factor [ 64 65 ] . The power of LIF to regenerate muscle is seen in dystrophin null mdx mice, where exogenous LIF regenerates atrophied diaphragm muscle [ 66 ] . LIF induced signaling appears to be essential in muscle development as seen by muscle atrophy in the absence of LIFR on E18.
LIF is also responsible for increased GFAP expression [ 69 ] , while signaling through LIFR:gp130 is critical in fostering the differentiation of neuronal precursors into astrocytes [ 70 ] mediated through STAT3 [ 71 72 73 74 ] . Glial cells respond to GC, which, in turn, can affect transcriptional control of GFAP level either positively or negatively [ 74 ] . The present study shows that GC's can play a critical role in hindering astrocyte development in the absence of LIFR as seen through the partial abrogation of this defect following exposure to RU486 in Lifr -/- mice.
RU486 crosses the blood-brain-barrier and is present at only 28% of levels seen in the serum [ 75 ] . Perhaps glial development would be further improved in the presence of higher levels of RU486 were these levels not abortive.
This indicates that the improvement due to RU486 is implemented through modest alteration in GC regulation since complete loss of GR function leads to incomplete lung development at birth and impaired survival through atelectasis [ 77 ] . The neural compartment may have been under-protected by RU486 due to partial exclusion by the blood-brain-barrier, while bone and skeletal muscle, tissues exposed to higher levels of RU486, were clearly protected.
These results indicate that signaling through LIFR utilizing the LIFR:gp130 heterodimer is essential for an appropriate GC response during development.
LHR immunoreactivity in porcine fallopian tubes was confined to the epithelium and smooth muscle cells, and in vitro LH treatment caused relaxation of the oviduct [ 35 ] . Also, LHR stimulation plays a role in the induction and maintenance of myometrial quiescence [ 36 37 38 ] . Since smooth muscles belong among important compartments of the pelvic floor, high LH levels after menopause might be involved in the increased incidence of pelvic floor disorders, a common condition in postmenopausal women [ 39 ] . Since the brain was reported to express functional LHR [ 29 30 ] , there is also a possibility that high LH levels in aging individuals may in some way participate in the development and progression of neurodegenerative process of several degenerative neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.
With respect to the follicular and luteal development, porcine ovaries were macroscopically classified as follows: Early/mid follicular - medium sized antral follicles (3-5 mm) accompanied by shrinking fibrous corpora lutea of similar size; late follicular - large antral follicles (>5 mm) not accompanied by any luteal tissue; early/ mid luteal - large corpora lutea (~10 mm) characterized by yellowish color; and late luteal - CL of diminishing size (~7 mm) with massive bleeding into the central cavity (bluish color) and no accompanying follicles.
Early luteal development (fresh CL) was associated with very strong cytoplasmic LHR immunostaining of granulosa lutein cells migrating into the follicular cavity (gl, Fig.
4), which contain LHR+ CL at various stages of development and regression, and developing and mature preovulatory follicles.
Yet, elevated maternal mid-trimester chorionic gonadotropin is associated with fetal cerebral blood flow redistribution and adverse perinatal outcome [ 63 ] . In addition, estrogens, which are known to cause a diminution of high LH levels in postmenopausal women, have been reported to be effective in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease [ 72 73 74 ] . Microglia belong among cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system [ 75 ] . Since CG increases secretion of a variety of cytokines by monocytes, and induces their inflammatory reaction and phagocytic activity [ 76 77 78 79 ] , high LH levels in aging individuals may also activate resident macrophages in the central nervous system and contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease and other inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.
Abnormal placental LHR expression may play a role in the development of abnormal pregnancy and fetal outcome, and expression of LHR in the pelvic floor compartments suggests that high LH levels in postmenopausal women may contribute to pelvic floor relaxation and increased incidence of pelvic floor disorders.
High LH levels in aging individuals may also participate in the development of inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.
That maternal undernutrition can affect fetal ovarian development has been documented [ 1 ] . Experiments using the sheep as a paradigm indicate that meiotic maturation of germ cells is delayed by feed restriction [ 2 3 ] ; putative molecular mechanisms which mediate this effect are unknown.
The corpus luteum provides steroid hormonal support essential for the establishment and maintenance of early pregnancy [ 8 9 ] . Follicles undergo cycles of antral development and atresia throughout gestation [ 10 11 12 ] .
Unlike males, which continue to generate sperm cells by mitosis throughout their reproductive lives, mammalian females are generally born with their full complement of (meiotic) gametes [ 30 ] . The normal chronology of ovarian development follows a definitive pattern.
While cellular proliferation is a generic feature of normal germline development, so is programmed physiological death.
In the GC, BMP-2 mRNA is expressed in a precise manner, indicating that gene activity is regulated during follicle development.
This indicates that the GC become functionally diverse very early in follicle development, i.e. about the time the follicle has two layers of GC.
As the follicle undergoes its development to the preovulatory stage (i.e.
This finding is consistent with the intriguing idea that the theca may begin to develop very early in preantral folliculogenesis, i.e. during the initial steps of primary follicle development.
This loss of BMP-6 mRNA became evident soon after selection at E 0200 h, and continued through dominant follicle development.
As follicle development proceeded, the expression of BMP-15 mRNA increased dramatically and very high near maximal levels were seen after the third layer of GC had formed (Fig.
In the early stages of primary follicle development the levels of BMPR-IA mRNA in the oocyte increased and were maximal in late preantral follicles (Fig.
During the development of the dominant follicle, BMPR-IA mRNA was abundantly expressed but the signal appeared weaker than in the secondary follicles (Fig.
One of the most important concepts generated in the ovary BMP field is that oocyte derived GDF-9 [ 14 ] plays a role in the mechanisms governing the development of the second layer of GC i.e. the primary /secondary follicle transition.
One interesting implication of our BMP-2 data is that the GC have already attained different states of differentiation by the early stages of secondary follicle development Based on previous work [ 32 33 ] , it is not unreasonable to propose that oocyte morphogens may have control over GC fate beginning as early as the primary/secondary follicle transition.
First, we found that the genes encoding the BMP receptors (BMPR-IA, -IB, -II) are highly expressed in the DF throughout its course of development.
Finally, with regard to FSH action, FS has been shown to neutralize the bioactivity of the FSH inhibitor, BMP-15 [ 39 ] . It is possible, therefore, that the strong expression of FS by the DF may serve to modulate BMP-15 action such that sufficient FSH receptors are expressed in the GC to permit the development of a preovulatory follicle.
First, the classical view of CL development is that luteinization is inhibited by oocyte-derived luteinization inhibitors [ 32 40 41 ] , two of which have been identified as BMP-6 and -15 [ 8 12 ] . Therefore, the loss of oocyte BMP-6 and -15 at ovulation undoubtedly plays an especially prominent role in activating luteinization.
Further characterization of potential CAR cofactors, as well as the development of sensitive and direct ligand binding assays will be required to define the molecular mechanisms that account for the diverse effects of rexinoids on CAR transactivation.
Steroid hormone receptors (SHRs) are members of a family of ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate many biological processes, including metabolism, reproduction, and development.
The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is involved in many cytokines, hormones, and growth factors mediated signaling pathways to regulate a variety of biological responses, including development, cell differentiation, proliferation and survival [ 7 8 ] . Once STAT proteins are activated by tyrosine-phosphorylation, form homo or heterodimers that are translocated to the nucleus, where they can bind to specific sequences in the DNA, thereby stimulating gene transcription.
Activation of AR is a driving force in development and progression of prostate cancer.
In models for the risk factors, it may be inappropriate to combine height and weight as the BMI [ 14 ] . From the standpoint of CHD events, it may be more risky for shorter individuals to gain weight than for taller individuals because coronary artery diameter is likely to be higher in taller subjects [ 15 ] . By contrast, the risk of diabetes may be less dependent on height; persisting energy imbalances may lead to similar outcomes in terms of the development of insulin resistance.
This paper analyzed the effects of risk factors such as smoking, weight, HDL, LDL, and blood pressure for the development of chronic condition diabetes and CHD events using data from the FOS.
Early in female development, one of the two X chromosomes in each cell undergoes an ordered process of inactivation, with subsequent silencing of most genes on the inactive X chromosome [ 8].
X inactivation occurs at a very early time point in development, and thus the results in one tissue should reflect the general situation in the rest of the body.
This could be a chance event, or it may result from selection for certain X-linked alleles during embryonic development, as has been described in carriers of X-linked immunodeficiencies [ 17].

The correlation between the expression of these two markers therefore suggests the possibility that CCR6 may play a role in the development of aggregates of CD4 +T cells that are characteristically found in rheumatoid synovium.

Cultures supplemented with a mixture of 100 nmol dexamethasone, 0.05 mmol ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, and 10 mmol β-glycerophosphate (conditions that favor the development of osteoblasts) developed only round or cuboidal cells, and not fibroblast-like ones (Fig.
Recent studies [ 32] have suggested that there is an intrinsic defect in the development of IL-4-producing effector cells in RA patients.
MCP-1 has been shown to play an important role in the development of arthritis in MRL-lpr mice [ 22], whereas the migration of monocytes into inflammatory sites was reduced in the CCR2-deficient mouse [ 23].
Similar clonal development of antibody VH genes has been demonstrated in the SM in RA patients [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and in reactive arthritis (ReA) patients [ 16].
Recombinant human interleukin-11 (rhIL-11) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates the growth and development of hematopoietic stem cells and decreases the proinflammatory mediators of cytokine and nitric oxide production [ 1].
The cause of SSc is unknown but the early stage is characterized by a dense mononuclear cell infiltrate in tissues, suggesting that activation of the immune system results in the development of tissue fibrosis [ 3, 4].
The clinical observation that sexual dimorphism plays a role in the immune response suggests that the endocrine system is an important factor for the development and maintenance of the response.
Although it is arguable that our series of patients, not being a representative sample, is unsuitable for evaluation of the frequency of RAD in patients with hypogonadism, we investigated RAD only in those who had not been treated for their hypogonadism, to avoid the possibility that androgen replacement had interfered with the development of RAD [ 30, 31].
The development of RAD only in those patients with severe testicular dysfunction suggests that such dysfunction is one endogenous factor that predisposes to the development of RAD.
Despite the increased odds ratio for the development of SLE in such patients, the confidence interval was very wide, suggesting that other factors in addition to hormonal and genetic alterations affect the development of SLE in these patients.
Despite the increased odds ratio for the development of SLE in such patients, the confidence interval was very wide, suggesting that other factors in addition to hormonal and genetic alterations affect the development of SLE in these patients.
The development of dermatomyositis and JRA was higher in our patients than in the general population (
If our argument is correct, low serum testosterone levels favor the development of RAD in the hypogonadic male patient, while in the normogonadic male who develops RAD (mainly in RA) the decrease of testosterone serum levels is due to an increase in its metabolism for the activated immune system, with the subsequent elevation of E 2 . These differences could also explain the low or almost null association of RA and hypogonadism [ 13].
We chose this data baseline because it represents a large number of genes that may be expressed during development and again during disease pathology.
Tenascin, an adhesion molecule that is expressed during cartilage development [ 45], was induced by IL-1β in SW1353 cells (Table 2, panel C).
Interestingly, jagged-1 is important for epithelial-mesenchymal cell interaction in development [ 50], and mutations in the jagged gene lead to Alagille syndrome, a congenital connective tissue disorder whose hallmarks include craniofacial and vertebral deformities [ 51].
We have found that the development of PG-specific antibodies correlates with the development of arthritis, and that PG-specific autoantibodies increase the severity of disease.
We have found that the development of PG-specific antibodies correlates with the development of arthritis, and that PG-specific autoantibodies increase the severity of disease.
The correlation between PG-specific autoantibody isotype and development of arthritis suggests a pathological role for IgG2a isotype in disease.
While the disease is generally assumed to be age related, there is evidence that health risk behaviors that might be potentially modifiable are involved in its development [ 1, 2].
Antecedent infection with many different microbes is often associated with the development of autoimmune disease in humans, but the pathogenic mechanisms involved, if any, are unknown.
Experimental arthritis models have contributed to the basic understanding of joint disease and to the development of effective antiarthritic agents [ 19 ] . Several models have been used to mimic human RA, ranging from immunization with cartilage components to infection with joint trophic organisms [ 20 21 ] . Blocking TNF-α [ 6 22 ] or IL-1 [ 23 24 ] in these models has routinely shown benefit, although some questions remain regarding the role of these cytokines in mitigating joint inflammation versus preventing cartilage degradation and bone erosion [ 25 ] .
In animal models of arthritis, systemic treatment with IL-10 and adenovirus-mediated transfer of viral IL-10 moderately suppresses the development of arthritis, but is significantly more effective when combined with IL-4 [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 ] . The evidence for the importance of IL-10 is further supported by the fact that in vivo anti-IL-10 treatment accelerates disease in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) [ 22 ] .
To address the effects of complete elimination of IL-10 in vivo on the development of CIA and to understand the mechanism responsible for IL-10 regulation, we examined the development of arthritis in homozygous IL-10 -/-IL-10-deficient mice.
To address the effects of complete elimination of IL-10 in vivo on the development of CIA and to understand the mechanism responsible for IL-10 regulation, we examined the development of arthritis in homozygous IL-10 -/-IL-10-deficient mice.
To determine whether IL-10 functions as an endogenous inhibitor of inflammatory arthritis, we examined the development of disease using the CIA model.
In addition to the cellular immune response, anticollagen antibodies are required for the development of arthritis.
Considering the tremendous morbidity and cost of metabolic bone diseases [ 3 ] , improving our molecular understanding of osteoclast development and function is critical towards the design of therapies to combat these prevalent diseases.
It is probable that signals such as IFN-γ will be interpreted differently by precursors at various stages of development, with consequent effects on disease.
Recently, a subset of CD4 +T cells was identified that is present on 5-10% of CD4 +T cells in normal naïve mice and expresses CD25 (the α-chain of IL-2 receptor) [ 4 5 ] . Functional analysis of murine CD4 +CD25 +T cells showed that those cells, which constitutively express cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 [ 6 7 8 ] , fail to proliferate or secret cytokines in response to polyclonal or antigen-specific stimulation, but inhibit the activation of conventional responsive T cells [ 1 2 3 8 9 ] . The suppressive activity of the CD4 +CD25 +T cells depends on signaling via the negative regulator of T-cell activation CTLA-4 [ 7 ] and requires a cell-cell interaction that possibly involves cell surface bound transforming growth factor (TGF)-β 1 [ 1 10 ] . It has been shown that B7/CD28 costimulation is essential for the development and homeostasis of the CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells [ 6 ] , which play critical roles not only in preventing autoimmunity but also in controlling tumor immunity and transplantation tolerance [ 2 11 ] .
Proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA) is a novel autoimmune murine model that is induced by systemic immunization of BALB/c mice with cartilage proteoglycans [ 12 13 ] . The development of PGIA is based on the cross-reactive immune response between immunizing human and mouse (self) cartilage proteoglycans in genetically susceptible BALB/c mice [ 12 13 ] . Several lines of evidence indicate T-cell involvement in the pathogenesis of PGIA.
In order to determine whether CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells play a role in the development of PGIA, we monitored the CD4 +CD25 +-expressing regulatory T cells in mice with PGIA during an entire immunization period.
We also transferred purified CD4 +CD25 +T cells from naïve BALB/c mice together with spleen cells from arthritic animals, or alternatively transferred CD4 +CD25 +-depleted spleen cells from arthritic animals into SCID mice, and then monitored disease development in SCID mice.
Our data suggest that the CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells might not be essential for controlling the development of PGIA.
Lack of correlation between development of arthritis and expression of CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells in PGIA
This observation suggests that the CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells might not be involved in the development of PGIA.
Although it has been shown that the CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells can suppress the development of autoimmunity, a recent report [ 27 ] demonstrated that depletion of the CD4 +CD25 +T cells is necessary but not sufficient for induction of autoimmune gastritis.
Note that we used different ratios of the CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells to the effector cells, and we did not observe any suppression of arthritis development.
3d, right panel), which is consistent with a recent report that the effective function of the CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells is T-cell receptor (TCR) specific [ 28 ] . Collectively, our data suggest that the CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells may not be involved in the development of PGIA.
To investigate whether a deficiency in the CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells may lead to an increase in the development of PGIA, we immunized wild-type and CD28-deficient BALB/c mice with proteoglycan, and disease incidence was monitored.
These data suggest that the CD4 +CD25 +cells may not be involved in the development of PGIA.
No suppression of development of PGIA in SCID mice was observed.
Taken together, our data suggest that the CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells may not regulate the development of PGIA.
In induced models of autoimmunity, the CD28-B7 interaction has been shown to regulate disease susceptibility by rendering autoreactive T cells anergic, or alternatively by upregulating the threshold for autoreactive T-cell activation [ 30 ] . Furthermore, we previously showed that impaired Fas-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) of autoreactive T-helper-1 cells may be responsible for the development of PGIA [ 20 ] . Therefore, AICD and/or T-cell anergy, but not the CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells, may be responsible for deletion or inactivation of autoreactive T cells in autoimmune arthritis.
Our results showed that the percentage of the CD4 +CD25 +regulatory T cells does not change during the development of PGIA.
During normal B cell development, the processes of gene segment recombination and coding end processing yield nucleotide HCDR3 lengths that are characteristic and virtually invariant for an individual B-cell clone.
Although our results do not preclude the development of gene therapy approaches to express regulated TGF-β1 systemically to downmodulate the immune response, the results suggest that any clinical application of local TGF-β1 gene transfer should proceed with caution.
Smoking is known to be associated with production of RF [ 6 16 20 ] ; RF production, in turn, often precedes the development of clinical disease [ 12 16 ] . Furthermore, it appears to be independent of HLA-DR restricted immune response [ 13 ] . In our study, we found that this paradigm held well for men but not women.
Development of antibodies to DEK could even be a primary event in the pathogenesis of JRA, with disruption of nuclear events due to penetration of anti-DEK antibodies into living cells [ 35 ] . It remains to be determined whether anti-DEK antibodies are directly involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, or if they result from generally enhanced immunoreactivity.
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been implicated in the development and pathogenicity of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders, such as septic shock, arthritis, and hypotension [ 1 2 3 4 ] . It plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory cascade and, together with IL-1 and IL-6, has been shown to mediate the acute-phase response [ 5 6 ] . Confirmation of its significance in disease comes from the success of clinical trials using anti-TNF therapy to treat rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease [ 7 8 9 10 ] .
Early work by Carballo and colleagues [ 38 ] showed the importance of macrophages, not lymphocytes, in the development of the phenotype associated with TTP deficiency.
TNF is a predominant proinflammatory cytokine, particularly in sepsis and chronic inflammatory disorders suggesting that the role of its negative regulator, TTP, may be of functional importance in the development and pathogenesis of disease.
In conclusion, we have provided evidence that active MMP-2 complexes are detectable in the inflamed RA synovium and may be involved in the development of early bony erosions.
Although the pathologic processes that underlie the development of erosions are incompletely understood, a considerable body of evidence has suggested that a pannus of cells that originate in chronically inflamed, proliferative synovial tissue becomes locally invasive, and enzymatically degrades the matrix of the articular cartilage and periarticular bone [ 4].
Overall, the present observations suggest an association between the presence of active synovial gelatinases and the early development of erosive articular damage.
In the present study we provided evidence that active MMP-2 complexes are expressed in the synovium and may be involved in the development of bony erosions.
Although the etiologies and pathologies of RA and OA differ, it is clear that in both of these diseases pro-inflammatory cytokines are present, resulting in an inflammatory state as well as cartilage degradation [ 14 ] . As further evidence for the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) and anti-interleukin 1 (anti-IL-1) therapies can reduce inflammation and retard the progression of disease as assessed radiographically [ 15 16 ] . However, side-effects with these approaches, such as the development of lymphomas in patients using anti-TNF-α therapies, demonstrate that alternative therapies are needed [ 17 ] .
Naturally occurring triterpenoids, such as ursolic acid, have been found to have mild anti-inflammatory effects [ 18 27 ] . These have been improved with the development of synthetic triterpenoids such as CDDO, offering a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of arthritis and other diseases [ 19 20 21 ] . Furthermore, it has been reported that CDDO at high doses (5-10 μM) can have pro-apoptotic effects, ideal for the treatment of leukemia but of concern with regard to chondrocyte cell death [ 25 26 ] . However, we found that CDDO, at concentrations that decrease MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression (namely 300 nM and 1 μM), did not cause cell death.
During the preclinical development of IL-1Ra gene therapy, we often noticed that transfer of the IL-1Ra gene provided a far greater biologic effect than administration of the recombinant protein.
It will be of interest to find out whether the cumulative prevalence of specific autoantibody subsets tends to increase over time, as this would suggest that the mechanisms underlying the development of these reactivities continue to evolve over the course of the arthropathy.
Alternatively, it is possible that the development of anti-RA-33 reactivity increases as the diseases progresses.
It will be of interest to find out whether the cumulative prevalence of specific autoantibody subsets tends to increase over time, as this would suggest that the mechanisms underlying the development of these reactivities continue to evolve over the course of the arthropathy.
Chemoprevention has been defined as the use of noncytotoxic nutrients or pharmacologic agents to enhance intrinsic physiologic mechanisms that protect the organism against the development of mutant clones and their progression to malignant cancer.
Furthermore, loss of the receptor correlated with increased risk of subsequent development of invasive breast cancer.
Thus, loss of TGF-β response may be a very early event in the development of human breast cancer.
The NMU-induced rat model of mammary tumorigenesis is widely used for chemoprevention studies, and yields rapid development of hormonally responsive mammary tumors with 100% incidence [ 2, 4, 18].
To do this, the initiating agent is given at 8 weeks of age and the chemopreventive agent is started a week later, during the period of active development of the mammary gland.
Part of the chemopreventive efficacy of antiestrogens and retinoids in this model may therefore be due to a generalized decrease in ductal development.
By 12 weeks of treatment, all three chemopreventive agents had a significant effect on glandular histology, with tamoxifen and 9cRA showing the greatest suppression of ductal development and lobule formation, and 4-HPR showing a relatively mild effect.
Chemoprevention has been defined as the use of noncytotoxic nutrients or pharmacologic agents to enhance intrinsic physiologic mechanisms that protect the organism against the development of mutant clones and their progression to malignant cancer [ 27].
By 12 weeks of treatment, all three chemopreventive agents had a significant effect on glandular histology, with tamoxifen and 9cRA showing the greatest suppression of ductal development and lobule formation, and 4-HPR showing a relatively mild effect.
Thus, unlike in the colon, loss of TGF-β response may be a very early event in the development of human breast cancer.
The NMU-induced rat model of mammary tumorigenesis is widely used for chemoprevention studies and yields rapid development of hormonally responsive mammary tumors with 100% incidence [ 2, 4, 18].
Since sexual maturity is achieved at approximately 11 weeks of age in rats, this means that the chemopreventive agent is given during a period of active development of the mammary gland.
Specifically, there were fewer terminal end-buds and less tertiary branching, which are indicative of a delay or arrest in normal mammary development.
This is consistent with the known requirement for estrogen for proper mammary development [ 51].
Thus, part of the chemopreventive efficacy of antiestrogens and retinoids in this model may be due to a generalized decrease in ductal development.
Development of cell lines and cell culture
The finding of a nutritional effect on breast development before puberty agrees with the results from migrant studies demonstrating that it takes two or more generations to increase breast cancer risk.
Because of the lack of a lifetime history of soy intake in our study, we do not know whether soy consumption during early life when breast development occurred was similar to the current intake.
In conclusion, this examination of mammographic characteristics detected some associations with soy foods that suggest an influence of nutritional patterns on the development of the female breast.
A nutritional effect on breast development before puberty agrees with the results from migrant studies demonstrating that it takes two or more generations to increase breast cancer risk [ 31, 32].
We therefore do not know whether soy consumption during earlier life when breast development occurred was similar to the current intake.
In conclusion, this examination of mammographic characteristics detected some associations with soy foods that suggest an influence of nutritional patterns on the development of the female breast.
A complete understanding of the genetic events involved in breast tumorigenesis and their heterogeneity in relation to stage specificity will be critical to the development of successful treatments.
The heterogeneous nature of breast cancer alterations could have important implications for the development of targeted therapies.
A complete understanding of all the genetic events involved in breast tumorigenesis and their heterogeneity in relation to stage specificity will therefore be critical to the development of successful treatments.
Chromosome 18p LOH always occurred in conjunction with LOH on 3p, 9p, 17p and 17q independent of tumor stage, suggesting this group of loci were critical to the development of breast cancer.
In metastatic breast cancer, the development of a MDR phenotype is primarily responsible for insensitivity to a new drug [ 2].
The development of MCF7/ADR cells was induced by treating MCF7/WT with ADR.
None of the genes that were differentially expressed between these adjacent tumors had a known role in breast cancer development.
Germline mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 , which is located on chromosome 17q21, are associated with a predisposition to the development of cancer in these organs [ 1, 2].
Germline mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 , which is located on chromosome 17q21, are associated with a predisposition to the development of cancer in these organs [ 1, 2].
For example, analyses of mammary gland growth and development show high levels of BRCA1 expression in terminal end buds during puberty and in budding alveoli during pregnancy.
This is especially important during early embryonic development as well as in the development and function of adult tissues such as the gonadal cells (ie ovarian and testes) [ 41, 48].
This is especially important during early embryonic development as well as in the development and function of adult tissues such as the gonadal cells (ie ovarian and testes) [ 41, 48].
For example, BRCA1 expression is critical during development, as evidenced by the embryonic lethality in transgenic knockout mice [ 29, 30, 52].
The WHR, a measure of central adiposity, is gaining increased use as a measure of etiologically significant obesity and is thought to be more closely related to pathology, especially coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and stroke [ 7 ] . The metabolic changes that accompany obesity include peripheral hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased serum low-density lipoprotein, increased serum very low-density lipoprotein, increased serum leptin, dyslipidemia, increased serum cortisol clearance, increased serum C-peptide level, downregulation of insulin receptors and an exaggerated insulin response to an oral glucose load [ 12 13 14 15 ] . These changes, especially when they occur in early adulthood, may be of fundamental importance in the development of breast cancer [ 9 16 ] .
Obesity is also associated with significant hormonal changes such as decreased serum estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels, increased peripheral fat conversion of estrogens to progesterone and increased serum testosterone levels that may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer [ 17 ] . Estrogens are necessary for normal breast development, and they induce and promote mammary tumor growth in animal studies [ 18 ] . In addition, the close association between increased risk of breast cancer and certain reproductive factors such as early menarche and late menopause [ 19 ] , as well as the fall off in the rate of increase in the incidence of disease at menopause [ 20 ] and the lowered risk of breast cancer in oophorectomized women and those taking antiestrogens [ 21 22 ] , all support the role of estrogen in breast carcinogenesis.
In addition, further knowledge of the genetic mechanisms that play an important role in metastasis could ultimately lead to the development of improved therapeutic procedures.
HGF/SF induces mitogenic and morphogenic changes, including rapid membrane ruffling, formation of microspikes, and increased cellular motility [ 12 13 ] . The diverse biological effects of HGF/SF are all mediated by Met, which is preferentially expressed on epithelial cells [ 14 ] . In vivo this receptor-ligand pair is essential for normal embryonic development [ 15 16 ] . Whereas Met signaling clearly has a role in normal cellular processes, this signaling pathway has also been implicated in tumor development and progression.

HD proteins are involved in the control of development and differentiation in many organisms [ 3 4 ] . Initially discovered in Drosophila , mutations of the HB in homeobox genes result in vast morphologic abnormalities [ 3 ] . Subsequently, homologous HB genes have been cloned in many species including humans [ 5 6 7 ] .
Estrogen and progesterone, which stimulate the growth of breast epithelium, are two crucial hormones involved not only in normal breast development but also in carcinogenesis of breast epithelium and progression of breast cancer [ 28 ] . About 40% of breast cancers are ER-negative [ 28 ] . ER-negative tumors are unresponsive to anti-estrogen therapy, probably because of constitutive growth factor expression [ 28 29 ] . In general, these tumors have a higher histologic grade and a higher proliferative rate and are associated with poorer prognosis [ 28 ] . The finding that 100% of ER-negative tumors expressed BP1 might therefore be highly relevant to both the prognosis and therapy of those difficult-to-treat tumors.
Because BP1 was expressed in all tumor grades, we propose that it is activated in an early stage of malignant development or even in a premalignant state.
Because many questions required the recall of adolescent factors, the interview used three memory tools developed during the pilot phase of this study: a visualization exercise, a magnetic memory board, and photographs of girls at various stages of development in a variety of social settings.
As occurs typically, the predictive power is not as high in a cross-validation as in the original model development ( C = 0.83 in the Silber model), but the cross-validation C -statistic is strong evidence for the usefulness of the model.
OPN is a secreted glycophosphoprotein expressed by a number of cell types, including leukocytes and epithelial lineages, and it has been implicated biologically in bone development, in immune system regulation [ 6 ] , and in multiple mechanisms through signal transduction via its binding to integrins [ 7 ] . OPN has been detected in primary breast tumors and is elevated in the plasma of patients with metastatic breast cancer [ 8 9 ] , but an association between elevated levels of primary tumor OPN and metastatic burden has not been well established.
Clinically, TYRP-1 is thought to be important as a melanoma antigen that is highly antigenic to cytotoxic T cells, providing a potential target for melanoma vaccine development [ 16 ] . TYRP-1 appears to be less expressed in advanced primary lesions and metastases of human cutaneous melanoma and uveal melanoma [ 32 ] . Primary melanoma samples express TYRP-1 transcripts at higher levels than melanoma metastases [ 33 ] , and IHC analysis of malignant melanocytic lesions has shown that the invasive cells of primary melanomas are TYRP-1-negative [ 34 ] .
The major differences between isotype classes reside in the last 15-20 amino acids of the carboxy-termini [ 10 11 ] , and these differences have been exploited in the development of isotype-specific antibodies [ 12 13 14 ] . Mammalian microtubules are formed from a mixture of α-tubulin and β-tubulin isotype classes [ 11 15 16 ] , and the antimitotics used in chemotherapy interact primarily with β-tubulin.
The expression of genes encoding α-tubulin and β-tubulin seems to be developmentally regulated [ 19 ] . For example, tubulin isotype expression patterns change during the development and maturation of neurons [ 14 20 ] . Studies with paclitaxel or other antimitotic agents, such as colchicine or estramustine, indicate that drug interactions with tubulin isotypes differ [ 21 22 23 24 25 ] and might contribute to cell resistance to antimitotics [ 26 27 28 29 30 31 ] . However, one group of antimitotic agents, the vinca alkaloids, was shown to bind with similar affinity to all tubulin isotypes [ 12 ] , suggesting that alterations in drug binding affinity is unlikely to be the cause of drug resistance.
These results challenge the hypothesis of a universal role for tubulin isotypes in tumor growth and the development of drug resistance.
Consistent with our results is the finding of both β-tubulin classes I and II by immunostaining in many human tissues and cell types [ 60 ] . To understand the relationship between the drug target levels and the development of drug resistance, it is essential to know the actual protein amounts in tissues and cells.
The work presented here describes untreated tumors and should be useful for comparison with paclitaxel-treated tumors as a basis for evaluating tubulin isotype levels in response to therapy or in the development of drug resistance.
Delirium was defined as an organic mental disorder involving a confusional state with attention deficit, disorganized thinking and a fluctuating course and acute development.
To identify factors independently related to the development of delirium, we also performed forward stepwise (conditional) logistic regression.
Research into patients who developed hepatic failure suggests that the gamma-aminobutyric acid system is important in the development of hepatic encephalopathy (i.e.
From initial hospitalization until organ procurement or cessation of life support, the potential organ donor manifests daunting medical challenges due to the dramatic physiological changes that accompany the development of brain death.
An additional potential benefit of rapid brain death determination is the reduction in time for the development of significant end organ dysfunction, thereby increasing the number of organs procured per donor.
et al . [ 13], however, concluded in their study that t PTEF / t E is only weakly associated with the development of lower respiratory tract illness during the first year of life, and the ratio is less precise and an epidemiologically less useful measure than maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity.
Another potential reason for the inadequate calibration is the differences in case mix between our database and the development databases of the mortality prediction systems.
Medical patients constitute a larger proportion in our database (68%) than in the development databases (MPM II 0 , 45%; MPM II 24 , 48%; SAPS II, 49%; APACHE II, 58%) [ 2, 3, 4].
When the main diagnostic categories in our database are compared with those in the development database of APACHE II, some interesting differences appear.
315) accounts for 1.5% of our admissions, compared with 9.82% of the development database.
Our database also has more severe chronic illnesses (32%) compared with 5-29% in different participating ICUs in the APACHE II development database.
The development of pruritus, an important symptom of histamine release, is relatively frequent with vancomycin administration [ 2, 3, 4].
The secondary endpoint consisted of adverse occurrences including possible complications of drug therapy and morbid events such as the progression of initial infection and the development of secondary infection.
Recent attempts to define QoL have resulted in the development of a functional definition that is measurable, evaluable over time, and readily applied to patients over a wide range of illness severity.
Diminished volume of enteral feeds may also independently contribute to the development of cholestasis.
For example, lack of enteral feeding plays an important role in the development of cholestasis in the neonatal period, possibly mediated by direct hepatotoxic activity of bile salts [ 5].
There is increasing evidence that gastrointestinal hypoperfusion plays an important role in development of systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failure [ 1, 2].
The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive review of the safety of drotrecogin alfa (activated) for all adult patients with severe sepsis enrolled in clinical trials (completed and ongoing) since the start of phase 2 clinical development and up to 12 April 2002.
Maintenance of splanchnic blood flow is important because splanchnic hypoperfusion may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome [ 2 3 ] . Mechanical ventilation has been suggested to potentiate the adverse effects of underlying critical illness on splanchnic vasculature and contribute to the development of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, particularly when 'injurious' ventilatory strategies that produce high end-inspiratory lung volumes are employed [ 3 ] . Experimental studies suggested that mechanical ventilation with considerably high levels of PEEP can lead to splanchnic hypoperfusion and marked reduction in hepatic blood flow [ 4 5 6 ] . Furthermore, PEEP may decrease splanchnic blood flow in patients with no underlying lung disease [ 7 8 ] . Most available evidence regarding the effects of PEEP from animal studies has been extrapolated to humans based on the assumption that the effects of mechanical ventilation on humans and animals are similar.
A high incidence of adverse effects (nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity), along with the development of newer effective drugs with better safety profiles, resulted in the practical abandonment of systemic use of colistin, although it still remains active in vitro against practically all strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp.
On the other hand, experience with the drug in patients with cystic fibrosis, has shown only minimal nephrotoxicity [ 19 20 21 30 ] . Garnacho-Montero and coworkers [ 12 ] , in patients with VAP, observed that there was no significant difference in development of renal failure between colistin and imipenem.
Difficulty using strip chart EEGs utilizing analog technology stimulated the development of electronically processed digital EEG monitoring.
Indeed, the development of hypocalcemia in the critically ill has been shown to be associated with a poor prognosis [ 32, 33].
Yet, rural hospitals, fueled by community expectations and the need for expanded revenue sources, have expanded their scope of specialized services, which has led to the development of rural intensive care units (ICUs).
Development of specialized areas of care for the critically ill has occurred in most hospitals in the USA [ 1, 12, 13], leading to the growth in number and utilization of ICUs.
(3) Diffuse interstitial fibrosis : development of fibrosis suggested by chest X-ray or computed tomography or documented by open lung biopsy.
Scanning laser Doppler flowmetry is a recent development [ 24, 25] of the laser Doppler technique that may overcome these drawbacks.
The recent development of the scanning laser Doppler technique [ 24, 25] allows the rapid measurement of flow over a large predetermined area and, by collecting reflected light via mirrors, the previously requisite probe and optic cables are dispensed with and there is no contact with the skin itself.
With the development of emergency medicine, a need arose for evaluation scales that would provide rapid triage and objective status assessment.
The disappointingly slow progress in developing effective therapies for ischemic stroke has led to a re-evaluation of the strategies for stroke drug development and the methods used in clinical trials.
The fundamental premise of drug discovery and development in acute stroke is that treatments that reduce lesion size are those most likely to lead to clinical benefit.
There is thus a critical need for more controlled trials and for the development of better defined and more quantifiable endpoints.
Collateral vessel development, as measured by blood pressure, angiography, and vessel density, was significantly reduced in old (4-5 years old) versus young (6-8 months old) animals [ 27], in a rabbit model of hind limb ischemia.
Expression of the various isoforms during development is modulated both spatially and temporally [ 42], and observations from gene knockout studies have proven that these isoforms do not have equivalent biological functions during vessel development [ 42, 43].
Expression of the various isoforms during development is modulated both spatially and temporally [ 42], and observations from gene knockout studies have proven that these isoforms do not have equivalent biological functions during vessel development [ 42, 43].
Finally, since multiple VEGF-A isoforms are expressed during vascular development [ 42], it will also be important to determine whether the use of multiple isoforms in angiogenesis therapy will be necessary to replicate in vivo conditions.
normal vascular development has been shown to require the presence of the CD45 +/c-Kit +/CD34 +hematopoietic stem cells [ 58], which are similar and may be related to adult CEP cells.
Better designed studies and clinical trials that consider the issues discussed, coupled with well-defined and quantitative endpoints, will facilitate the development of novel and effective therapeutic approaches for ischemic diseases.
A number of distal protection devices that aim to reduce or eliminate distal embolization during percutaneous coronary and carotid interventions are under development (Table 1).
A second 'class' of distal protection devices under development and currently undergoing clinical investigation are the filter devices.
Some authors have recently explored the use of clustering methods to arrange the genes in some systematic way, with similar genes placed close together (see [ 2] for developments and [ 15] for an overview).
However, given the need to rapidly modulate apoptosis during development, cellular differentiation, and immune responses, this property of the apoptotic genes can be readily understood.
This process has been aided by the development of powerful algorithms and sensitive computational tools for detecting sequence and structural similarities between proteins.
The need for technologies that allow highly parallel quantitation of specific proteins in a rapid, low-cost and low-sample-volume format has become increasingly apparent with the growing recognition of the importance of global approaches to molecular characterization of physiology, development, and disease [ 1, 2].
Protein assays using ordered arrays have been explored since the development of multipin synthesis [ 10] and spot synthesis [ 11] of peptides on cellulose supports.
To demonstrate the progress of language development within the cell-biological domain, we will describe and discuss the G1/S checkpoint control model.
Even at this stage of development, BioD diagrams created by these general graphic and diagramming tools can be readily imported to available web page design tools to create, edit, link and post models on the internet (see sample BioD model sites [ 8, 9]).
Model development and testing can, therefore, become an integral part of early discovery and hypothesis testing all within the context of a single graphical description, rather than developing models simply as validations of well understood phenomena.
For instance, development of a common language to build accessible common models are critical elements in the 'blackboard' approach [ 41, 42] for multidisciplinary collaborations on complex problems.
In our approach, we have followed the model of recent developments of internet protocols, operating systems and computer languages by envisioning that if a core computational framework can be established, it can be extended and implemented for a variety of methods, languages and operating systems.
Thus we envision that, given the development of one (or more) editor applications, users could invent BioD language elements (functional properties, icons, arrows and models) as needed to describe specific domains.
As domain lexicons and model-model networks expand, with inevitable conflicts and duplications, we would suggest more global standardization be negotiated according to 'open-source' mechanisms of distributed, cooperative development [ 43] used for developing the Linux operating system and now being applied to SBML development [ 21].

By whatever mechanism, language development raises other key issues.
The development of an in-house array is a complex process, however, which must overcome a number of logistical problems.
It has been also hypothesized that olfactory receptors might provide molecular codes for cell-cell recognition in development and embryogenesis [ 40], including providing guidance for olfactory bulb glomeruli targeting by chemosensory neurons [ 9].
Not only should it be possible to sketch out the history of the development of different biochemical machineries, it should also be possible to establish which parts of the proteins are most critical to function on the basis of amino-acid sequence conservation correlated with the structural contexts.
These studies indicate that actin and the microtubule cytoskeleton play a pivotal role in cell expansion and branching during trichome development [ 32].
This striking result is consistent with the highly regulated and specific nature of embryonic development [ 40].
We suggest that trisomy of other chromosomes may exceed a limit of survivable dosage compensation during development.
A summary of the development of information on E. coli gene products over the past eight years is shown in Table 4. It is evident that much knowledge has been gained since these analyses began in 1993 [ 3, 24].
This information has helped to identify those genes expressed in particular stages of development and in specialized tissues or organs [ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
A relatively neglected area is the development of quantitative anatomical models of water movement for interpreting flux measurements [ 83].
the scoring scheme for TSDfinder was revised during its development to assign a scoring penalty to TSDs less than 12 nucleotides long.
Second, all families in Pfam-A and some in Pfam-B that have more than seven members are analyzed, as the Pfam-B database is under development and contains thousands of small protein families.
This 'literature profiling' produces a coherent picture of the functional relationships among large and heterogeneous lists of genes and should enable the development of tools for rapidly extracting meaningful knowledge from large microarray expression databases.
Although room exists for improvements in indexing, filtering and clustering strategies, the methodology described provides a blueprint for the development of computational tools that can rapidly assess literature content to guide the biological interpretation of complex expression data.
But the optimal exploitation of these invaluable resources by researchers necessitates the development of mining tools to explore and interpret data in a time frame compatible with the impressive rate at which they are generated.
We hope and anticipate that identification of these problems will facilitate that development of even more sophisticated analysis methods.
RSS in the dataset receive higher RIC values (and WM0 and WM1 values, see below) during genome searches than during model development, because the sequence for which RIC is calculated is excluded from the dataset during model development, a property of leave-one-out cross-validation [ 67].

In particular, gain of chromosomes 1q and 8q has been associated with the early development of HCC [ 12], whereas loss of chromosome 4q has been linked to increased aggressiveness of established tumors [ 11].
The recent development of murine whole-genome draft sequences [ 14] should speed the process of identifying disease genes underlying QTLs because several of the strains used for genome sequencing are the same as those that have been used to develop the majority of mouse QTLs so far identified.
A related ongoing development that should help this situation by reducing the number of potential candidate genes that remain within the QTL interval is reduction of the interval by fine mapping using specialized congenic strains or recombinant progeny testing [ 33, 38].
An analysis of these assemblies in light of the modifications to the algorithmic strategy made between assemblies should inform the development of WGS assembly software in general.
At the time we started building our system, Ensembl was also in an early stage of development.
While this was wasteful in terms of redundant software development, it did allow us to hone our system to the particular needs of our project.
The Sanger Institute coordinated the overall development of ACeDB and has relied upon ACeDB for the ongoing annotation of C. elegans and human genome sequence.
Taken together, these issues led to the development of Apollo.
Other genes likely to be missed are genes with small ORFs (because of the arbitrary length cutoffs we used, see Materials and methods), and genes expressed transiently during development, at very low levels, and/or in cells and tissues not represented by the DGC cDNA libraries.
Establishment of the annotation rules included the development of a set of controlled comments, that is, comments that are reproducibly phrased and are consistently used.
Finally, the comparative annotation of UTR sequences awaits the development of methods that accurately predict the non-coding components of gene models.
Cell-fate changes that occur during development are almost always accompanied by changes in gene expression.
Thus detailed knowledge of the spatial and temporal expression patterns for all genes will be an important step in deciphering the complex regulatory networks governing development.
Although RNA in situ hybridization is carried out on fixed tissues, examining a large number of differently staged specimens provides an overview of the dynamic changes in gene-expression patterns that occur during development.
Approaches using DNA microarrays have been successful in studying genome-wide transcriptional regulation during animal development [ 9, 10, 11], but suffer from several limitations.
In multicellular organisms, cell division and differentiation leads to an increase in tissue complexity throughout development, but whole-animal microarray analysis cannot document this spatial information.
We used high-throughput RNA in situ hybridization to assemble a database of gene-expression patterns during embryonic development of Drosophila melanogaster.
Moreover, studies of a large number of individual genes have documented the diversity of gene-expression patterns that occur during Drosophila embryogenesis and established the importance of tissue-specific gene expression for development.
The duration of developmental stages range from 15 minutes to more than 2 hours; therefore the stages of development were differentially represented in our embryo collections (see Materials and methods).
The groups of images assigned to a stage range are arranged in the web-based annotation tool from left to right so that one can follow the pattern through development (Figure 2).
For all these reasons, the most useful factor in correlating microarray and image data is the relative fluctuation of signal intensity over the course of development.
We used this embryological concept to define a set of embryonic structure names that depict a 'path' describing the development of each organ.
Using this naming scheme we are able to describe the development of embryonic structures starting from anlage in statu nascendi at the cellular blastoderm stage through a series of developmental intermediates - anlage and primordia - to a differentiated embryonic structure.
Using the annotation tool, one can follow and describe the development of each structure through its intermediates by observing the development of the staining pattern and selecting the appropriate annotation terms.
Using the annotation tool, one can follow and describe the development of each structure through its intermediates by observing the development of the staining pattern and selecting the appropriate annotation terms.
For the nomenclature we needed an agreed vocabulary of terms to describe the different anatomical features of the Drosophila embryo and the different stages of embryonic development.
This was provided to us by the controlled vocabularies of anatomy and development that have been constructed by FlyBase [ 23] over the past few years.
Our annotation uses a subset of 300 or so of the 5,800 terms in the FlyBase controlled vocabulary, many of which only apply to later stages of development.
It can be utilized to search for the expression pattern of an individual gene of interest, retrieve a list of genes expressed in a given embryonic structure, or set of structures, or all genes expressed at a certain stage of embryonic development.
Clustering of the annotation data and other data-mining approaches will establish sets of co-regulated genes that will provide a starting point for investigating cis -regulatory sequences that may elucidate novel regulatory relationships in development.
The controlled vocabulary used to annotate the gene-expression profiles is a subset of the FlyBase controlled vocabulary for anatomy and development [ 39].
However, manual approaches to data analysis are sometimes impractical or cumbersome, inspiring the development of tools to accomplish the three goals described above.
As a further development of the method described here, we envisage cluster analysis of the selected genes for higher dimensions ( k > 2).
By waiting until the young adult stage to administer DOX, all of pre-adult development is identical between control and experimental groups, and any difference in lifespan must be due to changes in the adult.
In Drosophila, RNAi can be initiated by injection of dsRNA into embryos, and this has allowed identification of novel phenotypes for genes during development [ 34].
Inactivation or downregulation of the genes specifically in the adult using tet-on RNAi may allow increased lifespan without confounding effects on development.
Lam and Thummel have recently reported the use of a heat-shock gene promoter to drive expression of dsRNA, and the efficient conditional inhibition of gene expression during larval and pupal stages of Drosophila development [ 39].
However, because of the rapid development of microarray technology, the latter is not likely and we expect a researcher will have to do his or her own pilot study.
Researchers can, in a fairly straightforward fashion, examine the overall transcriptional response of thousands of genes in normal cells and tissues, in disease states, in response to biological, genetic or chemical stimuli (such as drugs), or during normal biological processes such as cell-cycle progression and embryonic development [ 3, 4, 5].
There are no practical models of early development, when androgen exerts its most striking effects on the genitalia, body habitus and brain.
Comparison of the transcriptional programs induced by androgen in other examples of the diverse cells and tissues that respond to androgen will undoubtedly contribute to a molecular understanding of the basis of the diverse and profound effects of androgens on human development and physiology and in human diseases.
The ability to distinguish the effects of IL-2 in target tissues from its systemic effects may yield important insights for the development of improved anti-cancer therapies.
Efficient and reliable normalization procedures are an indispensable component of any statistical method; further development and analysis of error models for microarray data will be a worthwhile investment.
During the development of multicellular organisms, complexity builds sequentially in discrete steps as cells proliferate and their descendants choose between alternative developmental fates.
Another example is the glass gene, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that is expressed in many of the cell types in the eye imaginal disc and is required for photoreceptor development [ 2].
The distinct developmental phases of the imaginal discs, their easy accessibility, along with the numerous advantages of Drosophila as a model genetic and developmental organism make imaginal disc development an ideal system to explore the feasibility and usefulness of such an analysis at a genomic scale.
Rather, at these levels the distributions probably arise from evolutionary development centered on an underlying process of gene duplication.
Appreciation of the central role of EPKs in virtually every signaling pathway involved in normal development and disease [ 2] has stimulated much work on individual family members, as well as interesting subsets of the entire family.
Flower development provides one example where organs of distinctive morphologies (sepals, petals, stamens, carpels) are produced in rapid succession; specification of each floral organ requires temporally and spatially refined expression of specific genes [ 1].
In plants with perfect flowers (male and female sexual organs, sepals and petals in the same flower), this gene family regulates inflorescence development, flower organ differentiation, flowering time and specification of floral cell type [ 1].
Because the husks were morphologically fully expanded leaf sheaths surrounding the ear, it was surprising that they expressed the same genes, such as MADS-box genes that are associated with early stages of flower development.
This enzyme has several proposed functions, such as gluco-neogenesis in germinating seeds, carbon recovery during senescence, nitrogen assimilation during seed development and decarboxylation of OAA in PEPCK-type C4 photosynthesis [ 36, 37].
In a gene-expression study during Poplar wood development, > 40% genes were differentially expressed in different development zones within the vascular meristem [ 42].
In a gene-expression study during Poplar wood development, > 40% genes were differentially expressed in different development zones within the vascular meristem [ 42].
Another development initiative is to support conclusions based on the microarray data, for example the ability to indicate sequence motifs or biological effects (such as mortality) associated with individual (or sets of) nodes in a cluster.
The success of this project largely depends on the development, availability, and use of ontological terms not defined in the MAGE project.
We are actively interested in this problem and look forward to interacting with these development efforts.
The first key step in this process is the development of databases (public and private) to warehouse the experimental results.
The preliminary spatial normalization method presented in this work will require further validation and development as the current method, by visual inspection, appears to be overfitting the cDNA data.
From those, 40 robust PCR products were obtained and selected for development into new CAPS markers.
We anticipate that this general approach will contribute significantly to the development of dense molecular marker maps for a variety of higher plant species to expedite map-based cloning.
In light of recent developments in understanding the biology of Toll-like receptors, the NFκB-dominated responses we observe fit well within a model in which undifferentiated, subconfluent Caco-2 cells can recognize Gram-positive cell-surface moieties and induce what is termed an 'innate immune response'.
A recent report indicates that during the development of host-microbial interactions, essentially no proinflammatory or innate immune responses are detected as the intestines of germ-free mice become colonized [ 22].
Development of our control set of 10 Arabidopsis oligonucleotides and corresponding set of PCR amplicons subcloned into pSP64poly(A) serve as a valuable quality-control resource for cDNA/oligo microarrays.
For example, searching for the gene alpha-myosin heavy chain using its SWISS-PROT identifier MYH6_MOUSE or its MGD identifier MGI:97255 finds the GO process terms 'striated muscle contraction', 'cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis', 'protein modification', and 'muscle development'.
The publicly available mouse microarray dataset, the FVB benchmark set for cardiac development, maturation and aging, was obtained from the CardioGenomics Program for Genomics Applications [ 14].
These data compare healthy mouse hearts at different time points during development, using male and female FVB/N mice.
The bacterial cell wall is dynamic, and undergoes reorganization during vegetative growth, development and cell division [ 1, 2, 6, 7, 8].
The ortholog of the vertebrate LRAT, Egl-29 in C. elegans has been implicated in the development of the vulva [ 57].
This could raise the interesting possibility of Egl-29 synthesizing an ester similar to the retinyl esters that might function as a secreted differentiation signal during vulval development.
In previous experiments approximately 7% of PdL insertions were found to cause lethal and visible phenotypes when the PdL promoter was activated during larval and pupal development [ 34].
The increase in drug resistance throughout the malaria endemic regions is cause for great concern and calls for the development of new antimalarial measures, which would involve a larger variety of drug targets as well as a wider array of vaccine strategies (reviewed in [ 2, 3]).
Subsequently, we constructed a long-oligonucleotide-based P. falciparum microarray, which we used to evaluate changes in the global expression profile between two distinct stages of P. falciparum erythrocytic-stage asexual development - mid-trophozoite and mid-schizont.
The large number of differentially expressed genes detected in this analysis suggests that extensive transcriptional regulation has a major role in the functional specialization of parasite development.
Overall, the emergent gene clusters suggest that the trophozoite stage, a central phase of plasmodial intraerythrocytic development, is characterized by the activation of general cellular growth functions such as transcription, translation and hemoglobin degradation and biosynthesis of basic metabolites.
A second functional group of genes with increased expression in schizonts encodes proteins that are thought to function on the periphery of a newly infected erythrocyte at the early stages of asexual development.
In summary, the schizont stage of plasmodial development featured genes predominantly occupied with the process of merozoite function as well as the advance synthesis of transcripts for proteins that facilitate parasite establishment within the newly infected erythrocyte.
The gene-expression maps typically comprise genome-wide expression profiles at a number of different stages of cellular development, profiles of multiple strains and genetic variants, and global expression responses to number of growth perturbations and growth-inhibitory drugs.
Further understanding of cellular physiology of this parasite including basic metabolic functions and the intricate interactions between the parasite cell and human host immune system will be a key step in uncovering new targets for antimalarial drug discoveries and vaccine development.
Some of these differences appear to be in known rod-specific genes, and may reflect developmental asynchrony, as this is the time at which high-level expression of rod-specific genes is first observed, although most of the observed differences do not appear to be found in genes that show dramatic variation in expression through development.
, data not shown), a small subset of these results probably partially reflect minor differences in developmental timing, and some of the other differences in tag abundance may also reflect variation in genes expressed in a dynamic manner during development.
For example, litters of inbred mice sometimes have a runt, suggesting a difference in rate of development and/or other factors.
However, much of our data collected and analyzed for other purposes would suggest that such outliers are rare, at least with respect to eye development [ 13 23 ] .
Moreover, the high variability that is seen in both the development and gene-expression profiles of cloned mice [ 34 51 ] , and the relatively low heritability of many quantitative traits such as lifespan or psychiatric illness that is observed in monozygotic twins [ 52 53 ] , implies that there is substantial variability in gene expression even in genetically identical individuals, particularly in tissues of the CNS.
Within the vertebrates, there are several mechanisms that account for sexually dimorphic development.
Because temperature controls sexual development in crocodiles, many turtles and some lizards, environmental sex determination (ESD) has been proposed to be the primordial vertebrate mechanism for sexual differentiation [ 4].
If a control gene confers sexual development by dosage, it might become lost from the alternative sex chromosome.
Alternatively, if a control gene confers sexual development as a dominant determining factor, it may have evolved as an allele of a gene on the opposite sex chromosome.
Although the initial cloning of ASW pre-dated knowledge that Hint is an enzyme, both groups suggested that Asw might function by a dominant-negative mechanism through heterodimerization with Hint, thereby inducing female development [ 33, 34].
Turning to genetic analysis, if ASW has a significant role in feminization of birds, then viruses that increase expression of Asw may promote female development in ZZ eggs, potentially in a manner that requires Gln127.
If HINT is part of the Z chromosome that works by gene dosage, then viruses that direct expression of Hint may promote male or intersexual development in ZW eggs as was seen with ZZW triploids [ 20].
They also respond by the localized activation of a cell-death program, designated the hypersensitive response (HR), and by the systemic activation of cellular and molecular defenses, termed systemic acquired resistance (SAR) [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ] . Second messengers that contribute to the development of the systemic response include reactive oxygen species (ROS), SA, JA and ethylene [ 8 9 10 ] . There is evidence for commonalities between plant responses to pathogens (referred to as defense responses) and environmental stresses (referred to as stress responses) [ 11 12 ] . Despite similarities, however, a plant's response to each environmental challenge is unique and tailored to increasing the plant's ability to survive the inciting stress [ 13 14 15 16 ] .
The availability of both avirulent and virulent strains of these pathogens facilitates identification of genes that are important for resistance, as well as those expressed during disease development [ 19 20 21 ] . Moreover, both of these pathogens cause severe damage to crops of economic importance, such as tomato and crucifers [ 19 ] . We also treated plants with SA and methyl jasmonate (MJ) because both are important signaling molecules implicated in plant responses to pathogens, herbivory and wounding and they induce different aspects of the SAR [ 22 ] .
The WRKY transcription factors are involved in defense, wounding, senescence and plant development [ 7 16 70 71 72 73 ] . There are 70 genes with a WRKY domain in the Arabidopsis genome and six of them (WRKY15, 25, 33, 46, 62, 70) are in the stress cDNA collection.
On hatching from the eggshell, L2 worms are able to locate and migrate towards a potential host plant, penetrate the root behind its tip in the zone of elongation, and migrate intercellularly through the vascular cylinder by separating cells at the middle lamella [ 4 ] . The migration is enabled by a combination of stylet protrusion (mechanical force) and secretion of cell-wall-degrading enzymes from specialized glands [ 5 6 7 8 ] . Upon completion of migration, secretions from the nematode's glands, and potentially other cues, induce root cells to alter their development and gene expression, undergoing abnormal growth and repeated endomitotic rounds of replication to form a feeding site made up of giant cells [ 9 10 ] . The L2 feeds from the giant cells for 10-12 days, then ceases feeding and molts three times over the next two days to form the adult.
The availability of ESTs representing different developmental stages of Meloidogyne will allow an examination of changes in gene representation between stages, and in turn an understanding of the relative importance of various metabolic processes at different stages of development.
Development of GoMiner
In addition to the deployed components, we have introduced a number of open-source tools to enhance the development environment.
In particular, the Concurrent Versions System (CVS) tool [ 21 ] coordinates program development at the Georgia Institute of Technology with that at the NCI, and also coordinates development within each of the groups.

Flow cytometric annexin V and TUNEL assays verified important differences in apoptotic potential between the cell lines, and analysis generated a novel hypothesis (the 'permissive apoptosis-resistance' hypothesis) for the relationship between apoptotic and cell-proliferation pathways in the development of drug resistance.
1 study was initially done one gene at a time before development of GoMiner (and, in fact, motivated that development).
1 study was initially done one gene at a time before development of GoMiner (and, in fact, motivated that development).
This high-throughput capability has made two further developments possible: first, randomization studies are being done to address the multiple-comparisons problem (that is, to estimate the fraction of false positives among the selected categories); second, the output data stream is being coupled with integrated downstream analysis for automated recognition of interesting results buried within a large number of exploratory experiments.
In conclusion, GoMiner will continue in development with a view to integration with other bioinformatic resources being generated by the NCI and NIH for use by the biomedical research community.
Tubulin levels do not change during the acute phase of CCl 4 poisoning, but have been shown to decrease in association with the development of fatty liver tissue as a result of chronic CCl 4 exposure [ 18 19 ] . In the present study, tubulin was positively correlated with the three components of clear space, perhaps indicating cellular reorganization.
These synthetic data in which the clusters are known are crucial for the development and testing of novel clustering algorithms.
Another practical methodological development would be to incorporate the estimation of missing data values into the model-based approaches.
Development of the male genitalia is largely controlled by cells in the urogenital mesenchyme that express androgen receptors (AR) [ 1 2 ] . Germline mutations of the AR gene produce a spectrum of developmental abnormalities in 46,XY individuals ranging from infertility or mild hypospadias to complete feminization, which are collectively referred to as the androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS).
We hypothesized that the AR-dependent mesenchymal programs underlying male external genitalia development might be illuminated by comparing the transcriptional profile of mesenchyme-derived stromal cells from normal males to those from individuals affected with AIS.
Comparison of expression patterns in genital fibroblasts from normal and AIS-affected individuals, and fibroblasts from extragenital sites, offers possible insights into the programs that underlie genital development.
A critical question raised by these results is whether the observed differences between genital fibroblasts from males and AIS females reflect cell-autonomous effects of androgen exposure during development, or indirect effects of the AR-dependent genital morphogenetic program.
The discrepancy between the female phenotype of these mosaic individuals despite expression of the wild-type AR in cultured genital skin fibroblasts is not resolved to date [ 7 ] . It may be explained by a time-dependent rise of an originally small fraction of cells containing the wild-type AR allele in the mosaic genital mesenchyme during prenatal and postnatal development, or by differences between in vivo and in vitro conditions.
Comparison of gene-expression patterns in genital fibroblasts from normal and AIS-affected individuals, and in fibroblasts from extragenital sites, may offer clues to the programs that underlie external genital development.
Both cell adhesion and connective tissue remodeling are indispensable for normal development and maintenance of tissue integrity [ 13 14 15 ] . The differential expression of proteoglycans, collagens and cell adhesion molecules (for example cadherin 13) might be involved in genital morphogenesis and later stability of sexually dimorphic traits of the external genitalia.
Several genes expressed specifically in the normal male foreskin fibroblasts have been previously implicated in male genital development, including HOXA13 , the T-box genes, BMP4 and DWnt2 . Mutations in HOXA13 can cause distal limb and urogenital-tract malformations such as male hypospadias in hand-foot-genital syndrome [ 21 ] . T-box genes ( TBX ) are essential early regulators of limb development and also appear to be involved in male genital development [ 22 23 ] . Mutations in TBX3 cause the ulnar-mammary syndrome characterized by limb, apocrine, and genital developmental abnormalities [ 23 ] . Expression of T-box genes 2, 3, and 5 was significantly higher in normal male foreskin fibroblasts than in AIS genital fibroblasts.

BMP4 has been implicated in ductal budding and branching during prostate development [ 24 ] and a potential role of BMP4 in external genital development has also been postulated [ 25 ] . DWnt2 has been found to have roles in sex-specific cell determination in the gonads and genital disc of Drosophila [ 26 ] . Thus, mutations in genes characteristically expressed in normal male foreskin fibroblasts can, in some cases, lead to defective genital development.

As normal genital skin fibroblasts of 46,XY male individuals express the AR in vitro (see Table 1and [ 4 7 ] ), we had anticipated that androgen treatment would elicit a transcriptional response program that could provide additional insights into the role of androgen in genital development.
It is possible that genital mesenchymal cells are only capable of responding to androgen at discrete stages in development in their specific in vivo environment.
In mice, stromal androgen responsiveness is restricted to the earliest stages in prostate development, and later the epithelial compartment becomes responsive and remains so [ 1 ] . This responsiveness may be mediated through the expression of specific AR co-regulators.
Thus, genital fibroblasts may express critical AR co-regulators at discrete times during development that allow them to respond by setting up long-lasting transcriptional programs that underlie the genesis and maintenance of genital morphology.
Comparison of the expression patterns of genital fibroblasts from 46,XY normal males and 46,XY females with inactivated AR provides a window on the AR-dependent gene-expression programs within the urogenital mesenchyme, which contribute to the development and structural integrity of male and female genitalia.
The apparent lack of response of genital fibroblasts to androgen in vitro , despite expression of a normal AR, has important implications for future research in defining the role of androgen in genital development and the pathogenesis of ambiguous genitalia.
Transcriptional profiling of the early stages of genital development in vivo in the presence and absence of androgen may provide further insights into the role of androgen in genital development.
Transcriptional profiling of the early stages of genital development in vivo in the presence and absence of androgen may provide further insights into the role of androgen in genital development.
The expression profiles of computationally identifed miRNAs during development were much more heterogenous than those of the known set of embryonically derived miRNAs [ 10 ] . We identified miRNAs whose expression was highly restricted to individual developmental periods (embryogenesis, larval/pupal development, or adulthood), ones expressed in two of these developmental windows, and ones expressed throughout development, either at a relatively uniform level or in a progressive fashion.

Our observation that the temporal expression profile of miR-100 (Figure 5d) is similar to that described for let-7 and miR-125 (that is, expression is initiated during larval/pupal development and continues through adulthood [ 9 29 ] ) is consistent with probable coordinate expression of all three as a single pri-miRNA transcript, and may further implicate miR-100 in developmental timing.
Since the 'seed and soil' hypothesis of Paget in the 19th century [ 1 ] , it has been understood that the microenvironment, or 'soil,' surrounding the tumor 'seed' plays a critical part in its development.
In modeling mechanisms of cancer development, global gene-expression profiling of human-derived cells grown as tumors in mice has some distinct advantages over profiling of tumors obtained from patients.
In terms of new biological insight into cancer development, our findings suggest that cancer cells of different origins interact in different ways with the same extracellular environment to survive and proliferate as tumors.
Such quality assurance is critical to the future development of these resources if they are to be used in a meaningful way by experimentalists.
A combination of InterProScan and iGAP is under active development to integrate sequence- and structure-based annotation.
Some examples are listed in Table 4. For example, the AP2-domain is a DNA-binding transcription factor that controls flower and seed development [ 20 ] in Arabidopsis . The structure of the AP2 domain is found in the PDB (1gcc) [ 21 ] . Standard BLAST using the 1gcc sequence provides 140 hits at p < 0.1 (a very weak threshold).
The PAT database was initially developed as a joint development of academia and industry to serve the Arabidopsis and plant proteomics community through the provision of structure and functional assignment to all identified proteins in the Arabidopsis genome.
A workflow management system is under development to automate the processing and update of proteomes.
In conclusion, the development of any complete, in-silico discovery system requires full, query-based access to an integrated, up-to-date view of all relevant information, regardless of its physical location and content structure.
Still in its infancy, DAVID represents the foundation of our continued development efforts that aim to integrate information-rich data sources and provide quantitative summaries and analysis methods.
Fetuses of diabetic mothers with uncontrolled blood glucose levels tend to be hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic [ 1 ] . An increased incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) has been observed in infants of diabetic mothers [ 1 ] . RDS is caused by inadequate amounts of pulmonary surfactant due to delayed lung development [ 2 ] . It has been proposed that high insulin levels can delay lung development in the fetus of the diabetic mother [ 3 ] .

These concepts are not exclusive, and it is possible that several proteolytic and inflammatory mechanisms contribute to the development of emphysema.
It also has been suggested to play an important role in the development of emphysema.
In animals, instillation of NE can result in the development of pulmonary emphysema [ 18].
Individuals deficient in α-1 protease inhibitor, moreover, have an increased susceptibility to the development of emphysema [ 19, 20, 21].
Recent studies in genetically altered mice have suggested an important role for multiple proteases in the development of emphysema.
Mice deficient in MMP-9, MMP-12, or NE are resistant to the development of emphysema or skin blisters [ 8, 16].
Chronic NOS inhibition did not lead to development of pulmonary hypertension [ 3], however, possibly because of a decrease in cardiac output.
Additionally, we found increased severity of pulmonary hypertension in animals exposed to hypoxia during postnatal development.
Under more physiologically relevant levels of hypoxia, the central role of eNOS in protecting against hypertension is supported by our observation that loss of eNOS leads to increased acute hypoxic vasoconstriction and development of pulmonary hypertension [ 9, 10, 11, 12].

Resource development/fundraising ideas.
In other states, the very development and implementation of such initiatives may require reconfiguration of organizational relationships and service areas.

On the local and national levels, opportunities for professional development will grow and all staff members in a program, not just attorneys, take advantage of them.
I think that it is important for you to know that LSC initially stressed the importance of state planning in 1995 when it asked its recipients in each state to participate in the development of a plan for the design, configuration, and operation of LSC-funded programs in their states.
(1) development of intake, advice, and referral services; (2) effective usage of technology; (3) increased access to legal self-help and prevention information; (4) coordination of legal work, training, information, and expert assistance; (5) engagement of pro bono attorneys; (6) development of additional state, local, and private resources; and (7) optimal configuration of service areas.

Indeed, in recent internal budget battles within LSC, projects essential to the creation of world class delivery systems- such as the development of a new measurement system to measure our work and the work of our grantees in terms of outcomes for clients and projects to ensure that the delivery system is inclusive and multi-culturally competent-were summarily removed from the first drafts of the budget by the staff who prepare the budget.
LSC also launched companion initiatives-the quality initiative, the diversity initiative, technology initiative grants, to name just a few -that worked hand-in-glove with state planning to promote the development of high-quality delivery systems.
And this was an important-and perhaps in American legal services-quite revolutionary development.
iii Program Letter 1998-1, published on February 12, 1998, called upon all LSC recipients to analyze any progress made toward the development of the legal services model envisioned by state planners.

The three LSC-funded programs in Alabama have hired a statewide Director of Development, an experienced fundraiser who previously worked with the Red Cross and the Girl Scouts.
LSC currently provides over 90% of the funding for legal services in Alabama, and realization of the need for diverse funding is prompting the state justice community to create a development office that will seek diverse funding for legal services in Alabama.
Their combined expertise includes resource development, organizational management, technology, migrant and immigration law, access and intake systems.
Arizona, Arkansas, California, Illinois, Kentucky, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia received three-year terms as an acknowledgement of their "significant progress toward the development of comprehensive, integrated delivery systems."
Program reviews are one way to monitor program development, solve problems, and establish new strategies for expanding access and enhancing quality.
These reviews allowed us to monitor program development, to learn about problems and to suggest new strategies for expanding access and enhancing quality.

Their plans were to include responses to the seven central tenets of State Planning: (1) development of intake, advice, and referral services; (2) effective usage of technology; (3) increased access to legal self-help and prevention information; (4) coordination of legal work, training, information, and ex
pert assistance; (5) engagement of pro bono attorneys; (6) development of additional state, local, and private resources; and (7) optimal configuration of service areas.
In other states, the very development and implementation of such initiatives may require overhauling or establishing new organizational relationships and service areas.
17 Program Letter 1998-1, published on February 12, 1998, called upon all LSC recipients to analyze any progress made toward the development of the legal services model envisioned by state planners.
It challenged each state to examine its organizational structures, its use of technology, intake systems, resource development, and private bar involvement through a statewide lens.
These, companion initiatives and the hardworking and talented staff who carry out these initiatives, work hand-in-glove with the equally well-qualified state planning team to promote the development of high quality, world-class delivery systems.

X. Resource Development
Level LSC funding, census-related cuts in many program budgets, downturns in IOLTA and state government revenues made this past year one where LSC support for resource development was essential to the vitality of programs and state justice communities.
For example, our funds made it possible for Louisiana to adopt a multi-year development plan, and allowed West Virginia to launch a three-year private bar campaign that secured almost $300,000 in contributions and pledges prior to kickoff, with the expectation of reaching its goal of $1.
The first function acts as a forum for finding volunteers for such activities as consulting on cases, handling economic development transactions or working on intake systems.
Intrinsic to the development of the Program Letter, was the input we solicited on exemplary systems from individuals and organizations with special knowledge or experience about the topic.
Promoting the Development of Effective Legal Services
Conferees' answers to four questions (how to build collaborative relationships in rural environments; how to balance resources between urban and rural communities; how to achieve world-class delivery systems for rural clients; and how to expand resources for rural delivery) led to a list of broad recommendations for LSC and the legal services community, with particular emphasis on the development of a national voice for rural legal services.
timely information about key judicial, administrative and legislative developments at state and federal levels affecting eligible clients, and appropriate legal strategies to respond to those developments.

Older Patients with at-risk and problem drinking patterns: new developments in brief interventions.
Brown replied that only a certain proportion of the funding can be applied toward development in R-01 grants, and some of the technology, for example interactive videos, can be quite expensive to develop.
However, the program is still quite competitive, and the project would probably have to involve testing as well as development.
Longabaugh noted that R-21 grants, which are available for development of treatments, could be used to develop technologies.
2 This process may identify patients who have not yet developed severe dependence, thereby pre-venting the development of more intractable stages of alcoholism.
Funding for alcohol-related research needs to be provided to emergency department personnel on a priority basis because such funding will lead to their professional development, increase their national stature, lead to their advancement in professional societies, lead to association with policymakers, and enhance their opportunity to become opinion leaders.
The development of credible opinion leaders who are emergency medicine clinicians, who will endorse and advance the concept of alcohol screening and intervention, is the best means of fostering attitudinal change within that specialty.
Current funding sources are not structured to foster the development of leaders in emergency medicine who endorse the concept that addressing alcohol problems is their responsibility.
While their grant applications may not have the methodologic design that study sections composed of alcohol research specialists are accustomed to, funding such research will lead to the development of research methodologies appropriate to the emergency department setting.
will foster the development of a culture of acceptance of role responsibility to screen and intervene, and develop lobbying pressure to do so within the field of emergency medicine.
Interdisciplinary research is more likely to facilitate the development and implementation of emergency department interventions that work in the real world.
It provides a forum for the development of uniform policy and addresses the need to coordinate regulation of multi-state insurers.

Dr. Gentilello recommends the development of an ED alcohol research center.
He believed that the realities of our practice settings help drive the development of new ways of delivering counseling, for example, computer-based methods.
Efforts to further reduce the length of partial lifecycle toxicity tests for fish without compromising their predictive value have resulted in the development of an eight-day, embryo-larval survival and teratogenicity test for fish and other aquatic vertebrates (USEPA, 1981; Birge et al.
The tests are designed to provide dose-response information, expressed as the percent effluent concentration that affects the survival, fertilization, growth, and/or development within the prescribed period of time (40 minutes to seven days).
The data are used for NPDES permits development and to determine compliance with permit toxicity limits.
Modifications of these tests are also used in toxicity reduction evaluations and toxicity identification evaluations to identify the toxic components of an effluent, to aid in the development and implementation of toxicity reduction plans, and to compare and control the effectiveness of various treatment technologies for a given type of industry, irrespective of the receiving water (USEPA, 1988a; USEPA, 1988b; USEPA, 1989a; USEPA, 1989b; USEPA, 1991a).

The President's Energy Plan includes a number of conservation, advanced research and development, and other efforts that will reduce electricity usage.
The President's Energy Plan, and the climate change strategy that is under development, will provide benefits by addressing climate change.
To address global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, we are pursuing a broad array of conservation and energy efficiency goals under the Administration's National Energy Policy as well as the development of a comprehensive policy under the ongoing cabinet-level review for this issue.
That is why this Administration supports the development of new legislation that builds on the success of the market-based Acid Rain Program to reduce significantly the SO2, NOx and mercury emissions from power generation.
Two scenarios from Scenarios for a Clean Energy Future published by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which include assumptions about changes in consumer behavior, additional research and development, and voluntary and information programs.
The Clean Energy Future scenarios have been criticized on several grounds: assumed changes in consumer behavior that are not consistent with historic behavior patterns, results from research and development funding increases that have not occurred, and voluntary and information programs for which there is no analytic basis for evaluating the impacts.
The costs include: (1) direct investment costs, (2) operating and maintenance costs, (3) research and development and other government program costs, (4) transaction, search, and compliance costs, (5) adjustment costs associated with large changes in specific capital stocks, (6) lost economic flexibility created by additional emission requirements, and (7) potential interactions with the existing tax system.
The costs associated with the emission limits in each scenario are computed as the increased expenditures on pollution control, investment in more efficient equipment and appliances, research and development, tax incentives, and additional government programs - all relative to the reference case.
The standard technology assumptions of scenario A were used by EIA in the development of the AEO2001 "reference case" projections.
Moreover, both scenarios reflected increased spending for research and development and other programs designed to accelerate the development and deployment of low-carbon, energy efficient technologies.
Moreover, both scenarios reflected increased spending for research and development and other programs designed to accelerate the development and deployment of low-carbon, energy efficient technologies.
The scenario A reference case assumes a "business-as-usual" characterization of technology development and deployment.
The policies include increased research and development funding, equipment standards, financial incentives, voluntary programs, and other regulatory initiatives.
4 billion increase in cost-shared research, development, and demonstration of efficient and clean-energy technologies (in 1999 dollars with half as federal appropriations and half as private-sector cost share).
Moreover, the EIA suggests that there is little documentation to support the assumed technological improvements generated by the research and development (R&D) initiatives described in the report.
Because these expenditures ignore spending on energy efficiency, research and development outside the electricity sector-spending that can be substantial-they are not measures of program costs.
This reflects the cost of the program in terms of the decreased well being of households who must forego a fraction of their consumption of goods and services in order to pay for both research and development programs, energy efficiency improvements, and more expensive electricity production.
The goal of this research effort is to catalyze development and implementation of innovative, cost-effective environmental technologies; develop scientific and engineering information needed by EPA to support regulatory and policy decisions; and provide technical support and information transfer to ensure effective implementation of environmental regulations and strategies.

Technical guidance was received from Dr. Ravi Srivastava of the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, U.S.
The development of control technology alternatives to selective catalytic reduction (SCR) under the NOX State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call is another example of how alternative solutions may require fewer resources than the projected approach.
Also, other sorbent-based approaches in development may prove in time to be preferable to ACI, making the use of ACI only a conservative assumption.
Additionally, there are other technologies under development that potentially could reduce activated carbon demand from what is estimated here.
Under current law, the necessary reductions would be achieved through the development of individual state plans.
The "National Climate Change Technology Initiative" will accelerate priority research and the application of advanced energy and sequestration technologies, recognizing that the real answer to addressing climate change in the long term lies in the development and global introduction of such technologies in this century.
Section 482 contains provisions for evaluating and reporting the efficacy of the new sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury trading programs and conducting scientific and technical research and development.
Section II (Analytical Approach) discusses the analytic framework used in conducting this assessment, which includes scenario development, emissions modeling, air quality modeling, human health and visibility effects estimation, economic valuation, and adjustments for income growth and benefits aggregation.

Training and career development programs use both classroom instruction and rotational assignments.
In this practice we discuss the training, career development, and successionplanning strategies leading finance organizations use to develop a team with the right mix of skills and competencies.
The training and career development programs of the leading finance organizations we visited provided intensive 2to 3year entry level programs as well as midcareer and executivelevel programs that used both classroom instruction and rotational assignments to develop technical, management, and leadership skills and competencies.
However, the key to implementing a successful career development program is to complement course work with reallife business experience through the use of planned rotational assignments.
Using both classroom training, planned staff rotations, and interagency assignments, design a career development program geared toward
A variety of clear career path opportunities are offered and staff development programs are used as a means of exposing staff to different career opportunities.
As discussed in practice 10, sound training and career development strategies are needed for the finance organization to meet the current and future human capital needs of the business.
These organizations often used their staff development programs to provide these opportunities.
For example, as discussed in practice 10, career development programs often include rotational assignments and not only provide excellent growth opportunities but also expose staff to a variety of career path opportunities.

In addition, there are many aspects of information security, such as risk assessment, policy development, and disaster recovery planning, that require coordinated management attention.
In particular, senior executive recognition of information security risks and interest in taking steps to understand and manage these risks were the most important factors in prompting development of more formal information security programs.
In addition, the group participates in the company's strategic planning efforts and in the early stages of software development projects to ensure that security implications of these efforts are addressed.
However, the university had established an information security policy committee that included top university officials, legal counsel, and representatives from student affairs, faculty affairs, and internal audit to assist in the development and review of policies.
Case Example - Coordinating Policy Development and Awareness Activities
Since then, this individual's responsibilities for information security policy development and awareness, which had previously been handled on a part-time basis, have evolved into a full-time "awareness manager position" in the organization's central security group.
To reduce the chances of a similar incident, the awareness manager concurrently (1) coordinated the development of a policy describing organizational data classification standards and (2) developed a brochure and guidelines to publicize the new standards and educate employees on their implementation.
By coordinating policy development and awareness activities in this manner, she helps ensure that new risks and policies are communicated promptly and that employees are periodically reminded of existing policies through means such as monthly bulletins, an intranet web site, and presentations to new employees.
However, several security managers said that the development of automated monitoring tools is lagging behind the introduction of new computer and network technologies and that this has impaired their efforts to detect incidents, especially unauthorized intrusions.

The development of new service approaches and the enhancement of old ones in this new information era require the active participation of information management organizations from the beginning.
To reap the full benefits of information management reform, federal agencies must utilize the full potential of CIOs as information management leaders and active participants in the development of agency strategic plans and policies.
We would like to thank members of GAO«s Executive Council on Information Management and Technology for their comments and suggestions in the development of this guide.
Figure 1 illustrates the six fundamental principles described by the CIOs interviewed during the development of this guide.
Without credibility, the CIO organization will struggle to be accepted as a full participant in the development of new organizational systems and processes.
Once executive management endorses the centrality of the CIO organization and becomes a partner in the development of new systems, the CIO organization must execute its responsibilities successfully.
Performance measurement (principle IV) and information management human capital development (principle VI) are two areas that private, state, and federal CIOs all agreed must be addressed in order for the CIO and the supporting organization to be successful.
In both performance measurement and human capital development, practices used by the federal CIOs differed from those of CIOs in leading organizations, though federal CIOs were actively trying to address the issues.
At the same time, an understanding of the information technology and management practices of leading organizations could contribute to the development of improved CIO management practices in the federal sector.
Leading organizations further the two-way exchange of ideas and perspectives by bringing in experts from the field to advise or educate managers on recent trends and developments in both the business and technology arenas.
The new IT organization became responsible for such strategic activities as participating in the development of overall business strategies; prioritizing IT requirements; generating IT business plans; setting technical and architectural standards; managing user interfaces, outsourcing contracts, suppliers, and systems engineering; and allocating IT resources.

DOD has recognized the nature of this problem and has taken steps to address it, including advocating the use of best practices for product development from commercial companies.
Leading commercial companies have achieved more predictable outcomes from their product development processes because they identify and control design and manufacturing risks early and manage them effectively.
This report addresses how DOD can manage its weapon system acquisition process to ensure important knowledge about a system's design, critical manufacturing processes, and reliability is captured and used to make informed and timely decisions before committing to substantial development and production investments.
It identifies best practices to facilitate this decision making at two critical junctures-transition from system integration to system demonstration during product development and then transition into production.
In any new product development program there are three critical points that require the capture of specific knowledge to achieve successful outcomes.
Commercial companies insist that technology be mature at the outset of a product development program and, therefore, separate technology development from product development.

Commercial companies insist that technology be mature at the outset of a product development program and, therefore, separate technology development from product development.
Commercial companies understand the importance of capturing design and manufacturing knowledge early in product development, when costs to identify problems and make design changes to the product are significantly cheaper.
In a knowledge-based process, the achievement of each successive knowledge point builds on the preceding one, giving decision makers the knowledge they need-when they need it-to make decisions about whether to invest significant additional funds to move forward with product development.
Problems occur in programs when knowledge builds more slowly than commitments to enter product development or production.
If a decision is made to commit to develop and produce a design before the critical technology, design, or manufacturing knowledge is captured, problems will cascade and become magnified through the product development and production phases.
8, 2001) and Best Practices: Better Management of Technology Development Can Improve Weapon System Outcomes, GAO/NSIAD-99-162(Washington, D.C.: July 30, 1999).
A product development process includes two phases followed by production-integration phase and demonstration phase.
The commercial companies GAO visited achieved success in product development by first achieving a mature, stable design supported by completed engineering drawings during an integration phase and then by demonstrating that the product's design was reliable and critical manufacturing processes required to build it were in control before committing to full production.
Leading commercial companies employed practices to capture design and manufacturing knowledge in time for making key decisions during product development.
First, the companies kept the degree of the design challenge manageable before starting a new product development program by using an evolutionary approach to develop a product.
Second, the companies captured design and manufacturing knowledge before the two critical decision points in product development: when the design was demonstrated to be stable-the second knowledge point-and when the product was demonstrated to be producible at an affordable cost-the third knowledge point.
In addition, it does not require a decision review to enter the demonstration phase of product development.
Further, there is little incentive for DOD program managers to capture knowledge early in the development process.
In contrast, commercial companies encourage their managers to capture product design and manufacturing knowledge to identify and resolve problems early in development, before making significant increases in their investment.
Leading commercial companies do not make significant investments to continue a product development or its production until they have knowledge that the product's design works and it can be manufactured efficiently within cost and schedule expectations.
This approach reduced the amount of risk in the development of each increment, facilitating greater success in meeting cost, schedule, and performance requirements.
The commercial companies GAO visited used the evolutionary approach as their method for product development.
For the most part, DOD programs try to achieve the same leap in performance but in just one step, contributing to development times that can take over 15 years to deliver a new capability to the military user.
Second, each leading commercial company had a product development process that was prominent and central to its success.
The process was championed by executive leadership and embraced by product managers and development teams as an effective way to do business.
Critical to the product development process were activities that enabled the capture of specific design and manufacturing knowledge and decision reviews to determine if the knowledge captured would support the increased investment necessary to move to the next development phase or into production.
Critical to the product development process were activities that enabled the capture of specific design and manufacturing knowledge and decision reviews to determine if the knowledge captured would support the increased investment necessary to move to the next development phase or into production.
DOD recently changed its acquisition policy to emphasize evolutionary acquisition and establish separate integration and demonstration phases in the product development process.
It also lacks a decision review to proceed from the integration phase to the demonstration phase of product development.
While the right policy and criteria are necessary to ensure a disciplined, knowledge-based product development process, the incentives that influence the key players in the acquisition process will ultimately determine whether they will be used effectively.
This undermines a knowledge-based process for making product development decisions.
Instead, program managers and contractors push the capture of design and manufacturing knowledge to later in the development program to avoid the identification of problems that might stop or limit funding.
Because of this, they encourage their managers to capture product design and manufacturing knowledge to identify and resolve problems early in development, before making significant increases in their investment.
Over the next 5 years, starting in fiscal year 2003, DOD's request for weapon system development and acquisition funds is estimated to be $700 billion (see fig.
In view of the importance of DOD's investment in weapon systems, we have undertaken an extensive body of work that examines DOD's acquisition issues from a different, more cross-cutting perspective-one that draws lessons learned from the best commercial product development efforts to see if they apply to weapon system acquisitions.
This report looks at the core of the acquisition process, specifically product development and ways to successfully design and manufacture the product.
Figure 1: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, and Procurement Funding for Fiscal Years 1995 to 2007
Collectively, these practices ensure that a high level of knowledge exists about critical facets of the product at key junctures during development.
Such a knowledgebased process enables decision makers to be reasonably certain about critical facets of the product under development when they need this knowledge.
To ensure the right level of knowledge at each key decision point in product development, leading commercial companies separate technology from product development and take steps to ensure the product design is stabilized early so product performance and producibility can be demonstrated before production.

This environment has made it difficult for either DOD or congressional decision makers to make informed decisions because appropriate knowledge has not been available at key decision points in product development.

with actions aimed at reducing product development cycle times and improving the predictability of cost and schedule outcomes.
While these are good first steps, further use of best practices in product development would provide a greater opportunity to improve weapon system cost and schedule outcomes.
Our overall objective was to determine whether best practices offer methods to improve the way DOD ensures that the design is stable early in the development process and whether having manufacturing processes in control before production results in better cost, schedule, and quality outcomes in DOD major acquisition programs.
Specifically, we identified best practices that have led to more successful product development and production outcomes, compared the best practices to those used in DOD programs, and analyzed current weapon system acquisition guidance for applicability of best practices.
On the basis of our literature searches and discussions with experts, we identified a number of commercial companies as having innovative development processes and practices that resulted in successful product development.
On the basis of our literature searches and discussions with experts, we identified a number of commercial companies as having innovative development processes and practices that resulted in successful product development.
At each of the five companies, we conducted structured interviews with representatives to gather uniform and consistent information about each company's new product development processes and best practices.
During the past 5 years, we have gathered information on product development practices from such companies as 3M, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, Chrysler Corporation, Bombardier Aerospace, Ford Motor Company, Hughes Space and Communications, and Motorola Corporation.
Our report highlights several best practices in product development based on our fieldwork.
Representatives from the commercial companies visited told us that the development of their best practices has evolved over many years and that the practices continue to be improved based on lessons learned and new ideas and information.
Further, because of the sensitivity to how data that would show the actual outcomes of new product development efforts might affect their competitive standing, we did not obtain specific cost, schedule, and performance data.
Next, we compared and contrasted the best practices with product development practices used in five DOD major acquisition programs.
The Air Force expects to buy 341 at a total acquisition cost (development and procurement) estimated at $69.
The "hit-to-kill" missile capabilities represent a major part of the development program, as these are not capabilities included in prior versions of the Patriot system.
The development program began in 1992.
This basis for selection was to compare and contrast the development practices used on each with best practices used by the commercial companies.
Our analysis of the data was used as a basis to develop indicators of each program's development efficiencies and detailed questions to discuss product design and manufacturing practices.
This knowledge comes in the form of completed engineering drawings before transitioning from the system integration phase to the system demonstration phase of product development.
Conceptually, the product development process has two phases: a system integration phase to stabilize the product's design and a system demonstration phase to demonstrate the product can be manufactured affordably and work reliably.
Bypassing critical knowledge at either knowledge point will usually result in cost, schedule, and performance problems later in product development and production.
On these programs, the initial phase of production-sometimes known as low-rate initial production-was able to focus on building operational test articles and improving the production processes, instead of continuing the product's design and development.
The most problematic programs also started production before design and manufacturing development work was concluded.
In these cases, programs were producing items for the customers while making major product design and tooling changes, still establishing manufacturing processes, and conducting development testing.
These programs came very close to meeting their original cost and schedule estimates for product development.
Their development cost and schedule results significantly exceeded estimates.
At the 1999 critical design review, the estimated development and production costs totaled $2.
F-22 Program Experience The F-22 program began detailed design efforts in 1991 when it entered a planned 8-year product development phase.
At that time, the program office had estimated the cost to complete the development program at $19.
In 1997, an independent review team examined the program and determined the product development effort was underestimated.
Between 1995 and 1998, the development estimate for the F-22 increased by over $3.
As of December 2001, the estimated development cost was $26.
manufacturing problems that started during development.
The independent review team evaluated the cost impact on the production aircraft that would likely occur because of cost and schedule problems in development and found that production aircraft would have to begin later, at a slower pace, and cost more than expected.
This estimate was based on the effort needed so far to build the aircraft during product development.
Since it began in 1995, the ATIRCM/CMWS program has had significant cost growth and schedule delays during product development.
It was not until 1999, about 2 years after the critical design review, that program officials felt that the design had stabilized; however, by this time, the product development cost had increased 160 percent and production had been delayed by almost 3 years.
Many of the development units were built by hand, in different facilities, and with different processes and personnel.
Program officials stated that because they did not stabilize the design until late in development, manufacturing issues were not adequately addressed.
Leading commercial companies have been successful in achieving product development goals because they have found ways to enable the capture of design and manufacturing knowledge about the products they are developing in a timely way.
We found two practices that allowed leading commercial companies to capture necessary knowledge for product development.
First, they established a framework of evolutionary product development that limited the amount of design and manufacturing knowledge that had to be captured.
This framework limited the design challenge for any one new product development by requiring risky technology, design, or manufacturing requirements to be deferred until a future generation of the product.
Second, each company (1) employed a disciplined product development process that brought together and integrated all of the technologies, components, and subsystems required for the product to ensure the design was stable before entering product demonstration and (2) demonstrated the product was reliable and producible using proven manufacturing processes before entering production.
The product development process includes tools that both capture knowledge and tie this knowledge to decisions about the product's design and manufacturing processes before making commitments that would significantly affect company resources.

programs-the F-22, ATIRCMS, and PAC-3-did not closely approximate best practices in capturing design or manufacturing knowledge during product development.
They took on greater design challenges, had program reviews that were not supported by critical design and manufacturing knowledge, and made decisions to advance to the next phases of development without sufficient design and manufacturing knowledge.
This approach permitted companies to focus more on design and development with a limited array of new content and technologies in a program.
It also ensured that each company had the requisite knowledge for a product's design before investing in the development of manufacturing processes and facilities.
Design elements not achievable in the initial development were planned for subsequent development efforts in future generations of the product, but only when technologies were proven to be mature and other resources were available.
Design elements not achievable in the initial development were planned for subsequent development efforts in future generations of the product, but only when technologies were proven to be mature and other resources were available.
This approach reduces the amount of risk in the development of each increment, facilitating greater success in meeting cost, schedule, and performance requirements.
Each commercial company we visited used the evolutionary approach as the primary method of product development.
General Electric builds on the basic capability of a fielded product by introducing proven improvements in capability from its advanced engineering development team.
General Electric considers the introduction of immature technologies into fielded products or new engine development programs as a significant cost and schedule risk.
Its new product development process is primarily focused on reducing and managing risk for design changes and product

Now, both companies have new product development processes that actively manage the amount of new content that can be placed on a new product development effort.

Even during the development of its 797 mining truck, which it considered a major design challenge, it did not require the truck to achieve capabilities-such as prognostics for better maintenance-that it could not demonstrate or validate in the design in a timely manner.
Decisions are continually made throughout product development without knowing the cost and schedule ramifications.
Leading commercial companies we visited had spent significant amounts of time and resources to develop and evolve new product development processes that ensured design and manufacturing knowledge was captured at the two critical decision points in product development: when the product's design was demonstrated to be stable-knowledge point 2-and when the product was demonstrated to be producible at an affordable cost-knowledge point 3. The process established a disciplined framework to capture specific design and manufacturing knowledge about new products.

The process established a disciplined framework to capture specific design and manufacturing knowledge about new products.
Companies then used that knowledge to make informed decisions about moving forward in a new product development program.
Each commercial firm we visited had a new product development process that was prominent and central to the firm's successes.
Once the program achieved a stable design, the certainty of their cost and schedule estimates was substantially increased, allowing them to plan the balance of the product development program with high confidence.
Table 3 shows the activities required to capture design knowledge that leads to executive decisions about whether to transition to the next phase of development.
If the product under development was an incremental improvement to existing products, such as the next generation of a printer or engine, these companies used virtual prototypes for any components that were being used for the first time.
Prototypes at this stage in development were typically not built in a manufacturing facility.
Table 4 shows an example of the types and purposes for various kinds of prototypes used by Cummins Inc. depending on the amount of knowledge it needed to capture and the point it was in the development process.
Prototypes were used by commercial companies throughout the product development process and not just during product integration.
Table 4: Examples of Prototypes Used by Cummins Inc. at Various Stages of Product Development
Cummins, the world sales leader in diesel engines over 200 horsepower, effectively uses prototypes to ensure that a design is stable and believes in the value of prototyping throughout product development.
A Cummins representative stated that not using prototypes becomes a matter of "pay me now or pay me later," meaning that it is far less costly to demonstrate a product's design early in development with prototypes, concepts, and analyses than to incur the cost of significant design changes after a product has entered production-a much more costly environment to make changes.
In addition to using engineering prototypes during the product integration phase of product development, Cummins and other companies we visited used other prototypes-such as production representative prototypes-in the remaining product development phases before production, as shown in table 4, to demonstrate product reliability and process control.
In addition to using engineering prototypes during the product integration phase of product development, Cummins and other companies we visited used other prototypes-such as production representative prototypes-in the remaining product development phases before production, as shown in table 4, to demonstrate product reliability and process control.
That is, it tries to develop new products that increase the capabilities of existing product lines, but it limits the amount of new content on any one product development because new content inherently increases design risk.
Caterpillar was able to deliver this design in 18 months after the product development was started.
Each company had a design review process that began at the component level, continued through the subsystem level, and culminated with a critical design review of the integrated system to determine if the product was ready to progress to the next phase of development.
This decision point used the knowledge captured as exit criteria for moving to the next phase of development.
Options included canceling the development program, delaying the decision until all criteria were met, or moving ahead with a detailed plan to achieve criteria not met by a specific time when leadership would revisit the other options.
One company emphasized that if a major milestone is delayed, an appropriate adjustment should be made to the end date of the program, thereby avoiding compressing the time allotted for the rest of product development and managing the risks that subsequent milestones will be missed.
This decision point coincides with the companies' need to increase investments in the product development and continue to the next phase.
For this reason, the decision point was considered critical to achieving success in product development and could not be taken lightly.
Company officials told us that these two tools enabled a smooth transition from product development to production, resulting in better program outcomes.
Table 5 shows the activities required to capture manufacturing knowledge that leads to executive decisions about whether to transition from product development into production.
The earlier this takes place, the less impact it will have on the development and production program.
Several commercial companies we visited began gathering this data very early in development and tracked it throughout development.
Several commercial companies we visited began gathering this data very early in development and tracked it throughout development.
Before Caterpillar starts making parts, it estimates the product's reliability in its current stage of development based on knowledge captured from failure modes and effects analysis,6 component prototype testing, and past product experience.
If trade-offs are not possible, decision makers may decide not to go forward with the development.
Caterpillar improves the product's reliability during development by testing prototypes, uncovering failures, and incorporating design changes.
The commercial companies, after capturing specific manufacturing knowledge, had executive level reviews to determine if the product development had sufficiently progressed to permit a transition into production.
As a result, they experienced significant increases in development costs and production delays usually at the expense of other DOD programs.
AIM-9X Missile Program The AIM-9X development practices closely paralleled best practices used by the commercial companies we visited.
Program officials stated that testing of engineering prototypes uncovered problems with missile design and manufacturing tooling early in the development, during system integration, allowing time to re-design and re-test in follow-on configurations.
The F/A-18 E/F aircraft development program was able to take advantage of knowledge captured in developing and manufacturing prior versions of the aircraft.
The program also identified the critical manufacturing processes and collected statistical process control data early in product development.
It did not complete 90 percent of the necessary engineering drawings until 1998, after the first two development aircraft were delivered.
The F-22 program initially had taken steps to use statistical process control data during development and gain control of critical manufacturing processes by the full rate production decision.
Therefore, because of the immature design, initially manufactured development missiles were hand-made, took longer to build than planned, and suffered from poor quality.
According to program officials, there was little emphasis during development or initial production on using statistical control on critical manufacturing processes.
Most of the development missiles were built in specialty shops rather than in a manufacturing environment.
During development, the supplier had difficulty in designing and manufacturing this subsystem.
In addition, between 1995 and 1999, the development contract target price increased by 165 percent.
Program officials said that an immature design limited their ability to begin reliability testing earlier in development.
The program plans to build, develop, and test six additional development units during 2002 and 2003 that will incorporate design changes to fix the system failures.
As demonstrated by successful companies, using these criteria can help ensure that the right knowledge is collected at the right time and that it will provide the basis for key decisions to commit to significant increases in investment as product development moves forward.
While the right policy and criteria are necessary to ensure a disciplined, knowledge-based product development process, the incentives that influence the key players in the acquisition process will ultimately determine whether they will be used effectively.
These incentives undermine a knowledge-based process for making product development decisions.
Instead, program managers and contractors push the capture of design and manufacturing knowledge to later in the development program to avoid the identification of problems that might stop or limit its funding.
Such an approach invariably leads to added costs because programs are forced to fix problems late in development.
Because of this, they encourage their managers to capture product design and manufacturing knowledge to identify and resolve problems early in development, before making significant increases in their investment.
Greater emphasis on evolutionary acquisitions and structuring the product development process into two phases-system integration and system demonstration-were good first steps for DOD to achieve its goals of buying higher quality systems in less time and for lower costs.
In three of the five DOD program examples in chapter 3, managers decided to move forward in development, even when developers had failed to capture design and manufacturing knowledge to support increased investments.
The low-rate initial production decision occurs after this phase of product development.
With more specific knowledge in hand at the end of development, decision makers can make a more informed decision to move into production with assurances that the product will achieve its cost, schedule, and quality outcomes.
Finally, while DOD's policy separates product development into a two-stage process-integration and demonstration-it does not require a decision milestone to move from one stage to the next.
On the other hand, commercial companies consider this review a critical decision point in their product development process because it precedes a commitment to significantly increase their investment.
The incentives for program managers and product developers to gather knowledge and reduce risk are also critical to DOD's ability to adopt best practices for product development.
This environment results in higher risks and a greater reliance on cost-reimbursement10 contracts for longer periods of time during product development.
They are suitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contract performance, such as research and development work, do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy.
Also, if one product development takes more time and money to complete than expected, it denies the firm opportunities to invest those resources in other products.
Production is a dominant concern in commercial companies throughout the product development process and forces discipline and trade-offs in the design process.
annual basis in DOD, strong incentives exist for the program office to make optimistic assumptions about development cost and schedule.
Instead, DOD's product development environment relies on cost-type contracting throughout the entire product development process.
Instead, DOD's product development environment relies on cost-type contracting throughout the entire product development process.
Once in production, programs will cut quantities to maintain funding or once fielded, they rely on the operations and maintenance budget to pay for reliability problems not solved in development.
This approach means adopting and implementing an evolutionary approach to developing new weapon systems, improving policy to more closely approximate a knowledge-based product development process, and creating incentives for capturing and using knowledge for decision making.
Without an evolutionary approach as its foundation, the ability to capture design and manufacturing knowledge early in the development process is significantly reduced.
DOD has made improvements in its acquisition policy by incorporating guidance for evolutionary acquisition, creating guidelines for the development of a basic product that can be upgraded with additional capabilities as technologies present themselves.
As a result, programs often pass through each development phase and into production with an unstable design and insufficient knowledge about critical manufacturing processes and product reliability.
Additionally, DOD does not provide the proper incentives to encourage the use of best practices in capturing knowledge early in its development programs.
culture is to accept greater risks upfront and then fix problems later in the development program.
This framework limited the design challenge for any one new product development by allowing risky technology, design, or manufacturing requirements to be deferred until a future generation of the product.
Second, each company we visited used the same basic product development process and criteria for bringing together and integrating all of the technologies, components, and subsystems required for the product to ensure the design was stable and then demonstrating that the product was producible and reliable using proven manufacturing processes.
Their new product development process included key, high-level decision points before moving into product demonstration, and again before making the production decision that required specific, knowledge-based exit criteria.
Finally, leading companies created an environment for their managers that emphasized capturing design and manufacturing knowledge early, before committing substantial investments in a product development that made cancellation a more difficult decision to make.
To do this, it should ensure that its acquisition process captures specific design and manufacturing knowledge, includes decisions at key junctures in the development program, and provides incentives to use a knowledge-based process.
At this point, the design should be demonstrated to be stable so that during the next phase of development attention can be focused on demonstrating manufacturing processes and product reliability.
We agree there may be circumstances, such as in the development of software, when it makes good sense to progress with less than the best practice standard for drawings, but the DOD policy should maintain the requirement to achieve 90 percent drawings by the completion of the system integration phase.

development of audit methodologies, policies, and procedures.
Audit organizations should have a process, such as a human capital system, for recruitment, hiring, continuous development, and evaluation of staff to assist the organization in maintaining a workforce that has adequate competence.
Continuing education may include such topics as developments in audit standards and methodology, accounting, assessment of internal control, principles of management or supervision, information systems management, statistical sampling, financial statement analysis, evaluation design, and data analysis.
This guide is intended for use in planning and conducting risk assessments of computer hardware and software, telecommunications, and system development acquisitions.
A risk assessment is the process of identifying potential risks in a system under development and then determining the significance of each risk in terms of its likelihood and impact on the acquisition's cost, schedule, and ability
4: Development Progress 76 Figure II.
The audit approach described in this guide is intended to result in a risk assessment of an acquisition project at any point in its development.
Appendix II of this guide describes techniques to use in identifying software development risks of delays and cost overruns, known collectively as management metrics or indicators.
These techniques require information about the size of the system being developed and about progress after development has begun.
An auditor using this guide to review an acquisition that includes significant software development and has a contract in place should review appendix II for techniques to help identify variances from the agency's cost and schedule estimates.
The cost models described in appendix II can be used to make a rough estimate of how long a system development may require.
This acquisition guide is intended for use in reviewing any information technology acquisition, regardless of the system development methodology being used.
The guide is structured around the federal acquisition process, and is independent of development methods for information systems.
An auditor should recognize that there are different system development models that may be used when a system development effort is acquired.
An auditor should recognize that there are different system development models that may be used when a system development effort is acquired.
Such models may include the "waterfall" model, rapid prototyping, or evolutionary development.
(1) focus on determining how one or more prototypesor incremental versions function to define the agency's requirements and (2) determine how the system development methodology used by the agency controls the prototyping process.
One approach to using prototyping as part of the system development process has been described as a "spiral" model of system development.

To ensure that the agency defines its requirements,based on the needs identified earlier and validated by functional users, well enough to support the acquisition of hardware, software, telecommunications, and system development services.
Assessing the test and acceptance phase may require a high level of technical skill on the part of auditors, such as when an agency has contracted for software development services and must test the quality of delivered software.
The auditor should be able to understand the system requirements, development methodologies, and test tools being used.
software development,
What, if any, development tools and techniques(such as Computer-Aided Software Engineering-CASE) are in use?
This appendix describes tools and techniques for measuring the status of acquisitions involving significant software development.
It describes techniques, known as software metrics, for quantitatively measuring how closely a project conforms to development plans and assessing whether an acquisition is at risk of delay or cost increases.
The metrics described here will generally be used after contract award, in order to assess how well the agency is managing the system development process.
Software metrics, which use mathematical models to measure elements of the development process, are intended to help organizations better understand and manage the relationships between resource decisions, development schedules, and the cost of software projects.
Software metrics, which use mathematical models to measure elements of the development process, are intended to help organizations better understand and manage the relationships between resource decisions, development schedules, and the cost of software projects.
By using software metric tools an auditor can independently evaluate software development projects by analyzing project budgets, requirements, schedules, and resources, and then confirm or question cost, schedule, and resource estimates.
They may be used before a solicitation for software development is
issued in order to assess the reasonableness of the agency's schedule (if a system design has been prepared), or after a contract has been awarded and software development has begun.
The other metrics described in this appendix require that system development work be underway.
However, cost models have significant limitations in accuracy unless their underlying assumptions of system size and cost drivers are carefully chosen and reflect the agency's previous experience in system development.
Auditors should also ensure that the model used is consistent with the software development methodology of the project under consideration.
assess how effectively an agency is managing a system development contract.
These indicators measure differences between what an agency planned for its contractor to accomplish by certain points in the systems development life cycle and the actual results.

Software Size This indicator records changes in the expected magnitude of the software development effort.
Changes in the expected system size may necessitate reestimates of the development cost, using the cost models described earlier in this appendix.
Personnel Stability Tracking the total number of people assigned to a system development effort compared to planned staffing levels provides another indicator of potential problems.

support of the development process.
As programs change and as agencies strive to improve operational processes and implement new technological developments, management must continually assess and evaluate its internal control to assure that the control activities being used are effective and updated when necessary.
Control activities are the policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that enforce management's directives, such as the process of adhering to requirements for budget development and execution.
This category includes entitywide security program planning, management, control over data center operations, system software acquisition and maintenance, access security, and application system development and maintenance.
Application system development and maintenance control provides the structure for safely developing new systems and modifying existing systems.
Included are documentation requirements; authorizations for undertaking projects; and reviews, testing, and approvals of development and modification activities before placing systems into operation.
An alternative to in-house development is the procurement of commercial software, but control is necessary to ensure that selected software meets the user's needs, and that it is properly placed into operation.
For example, operating information is required for development of financial reports.
We are sending copies of this letter to Senator George V. Voinovich, Chairman, and Senator Max S. Baucus, Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works; Representative Bob Franks, Chairman, and Representative Robert Wise, Jr., Ranking Democratic Member, Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, Hazardous Materials and Pipeline Transportation, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure; and to others upon request.
5 TPC is defined as the sum total of all costs associated with a project's planning, development, design, construction, outfitting, and startup, not including land costs.
Total project engineering costs average 20 percent of TPC (in addition to design costs discussed above, includes planning, development, and project management costs).
Comprehensive review of project document development during the design phase of acquisition should cost from 0.2 to 0.5 percent of TPC.
Procurement specialists trained primarily in contract negotiation and review rather than design and construction have been playing increasingly greater roles in facilities development.

Nearly all facility acquisition functions except agency policy development and oversight have been considered for outsourcing by one agency or another.
Most projects that fail to meet their planned objectives do so because of faulty or inadequate predesign development.
Today's general practice among federal agencies is to outsource design development and, to a lesser extent, certain specialized technical review functions, such as shop drawing reviews, value engineering, and constructability.
For example, the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions is published in the Federal Register twice each year by the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC), 1 and provides uniform reporting of data on regulatory activities under development throughout the federal government.
For example, the most recent edition of the Unified Agenda (April 2000) describes 4,441 rulemaking actions under development or recently completed by 60 federal departments and agencies.
§ 716(b), I am submitting this report because the Vice President, as Chair of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), has not provided the General Accounting Office (GAO) with access to certain records relating to the process by which the National Energy Policy was developed.
To this end, on June 21, his representatives provided us with 77 pages of miscellaneous documents purporting to relate to direct and indirect costs incurred in the development of the National Energy Policy.
As you know, the United States General Accounting Office (GAO) has been engaged in an ongoing effort to obtain certain narrowly defined, factual information concerning the development of the National Energy Policy proposal from Vice President Cheney in his role as Chair of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG).
As you know, the United States General Accounting Office (GAO) has been engaged in an ongoing effort to obtain certain narrowly defined, factual information concerning the development of the National Energy Policy proposal from Vice President Cheney in his role as Chair of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG).
This, plus the Senate's expected consideration of comprehensive energy legislation this session, reinforces the need for the information we requested concerning the development of the National Energy Policy proposal.
In addition, there are many aspects of information security, such as risk assessment, policy development, and disaster recovery planning, that require coordinated management attention.
In particular, senior executive recognition of information security risks and interest in taking steps to understand and manage these risks were the most important factors in prompting development of more formal information security programs.
In addition, the group participates in the company's strategic planning efforts and in the early stages of software development projects to ensure that security implications of these efforts are addressed.
However, the university had established an information security policy committee that included top university officials, legal counsel, and representatives from student affairs, faculty affairs, and internal audit to assist in the development and review of policies.
Case Example - Coordinating Policy Development and Awareness Activities
Since then, this individual's responsibilities for information security policy development and awareness, which had previously been handled on a part-time basis, have evolved into a full-time "awareness manager position" in the organization's central security group.
To reduce the chances of a similar incident, the awareness manager concurrently (1) coordinated the development of a policy describing organizational data classification standards and (2) developed a brochure and guidelines to publicize the new standards and educate employees on their implementation.
By coordinating policy development and awareness activities in this manner, she helps ensure that new risks and policies are communicated promptly and that employees are periodically reminded of existing policies through means such as monthly bulletins, an intranet web site, and presentations to new employees.
However, several security managers said that the development of automated monitoring tools is lagging behind the introduction of new computer and network technologies and that this has impaired their efforts to detect incidents, especially unauthorized intrusions.
In this regard, agencies must continually (1) explore and assess information security risks to business operations, (2) determine what policies, standards, and controls are worth implementing to reduce these risks, (3) promote awareness and understanding among program managers, computer users, and systems development staff, and

The five special function areas were (1) law enforcement and internal security, (2) intelligence, (3) foreign affairs, (4) national defense, and (5) research and development.
Members shared information concerning information security management practices, including corporate governance practices, business risk management processes, computing and network contract provisions, application development and support, disaster recovery planning, and performance measurement regarding control effectiveness.
For example, in many cases, one organization's members were willing to help each other by reviewing the requirement documentation for new systems development projects or system enhancement projects and participate in meetings to expose weaknesses and raise questions about a proposed project.
The discussion led to the development of a better, more secure system.
For example, one organization had to stop development of a secure Web site because the sponsor withdrew its support.

Because pork production in Sonora is a relatively new development and because the United States has restricted the importation of swine and pork products for the last 20 years, APHIS bases its potential impact analysis on some assumptions regarding the level of pork production in Sonora in the future, the percentage of pork production that might be processed in Sonora for shipment to the United States, and the demand for pork in the United States.

There are GAO case studies in many areas-urban housing, weapon systems testing, community development, military procurement contracts, influences on the Brazilian export-import balances, how programs aimed at improving water quality are working, and the implementation of block grants-to name only a few.
When the Department of Health and Human Services was trying out delivery of Head Start services to parents and children in their own homes, called Home Start, the Department supplemented a formal assessment of the development of the children before and after the program with case studies (High/Scope Educational Research Foundation, 1972).
The case studies told, too, of the development of the program over time and helped give a realistic sense of problems in start-up and implementation, how changes in staffing were accommodated, and the impact of shifting federal guidance on efforts to carry out the program in the field.
This series of reports also is useful for illustrating the way in which causality is established in case studies: through development of internally consistent explanations of what led to what and the conscientious use of information from within the site and from contrasting sites to rule out alternative explanations.

A frequency distribution of events-such as a table showing the number of decision points in a community economic development program and a decrease in the probability of action as the number of decision points increases-are about as numerical as qualitative data are likely to be in a research case study, according to some experts.
For example, those who supported an evaluation of a training program might want the researchers to find out whether the development of the participants' self-concepts, self-esteem, task orientation, work habits, and personal and social traits seemed associated with the program or with something else.

In research and development programs, this might consist of data for the year concerning the number of new projects initiated, the number continued from the prior year, the number completed and the number terminated.
38The research and development outputs and outcomes should be the same as those measured for the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and the budget and will be reported in a Statement of Program Performance Measures as described in Appendix 1-F to Entity and Display, SFFAC No.
Because of the difficulty of measuring such results for research and development programs in financial, economic, or quantitative terms, outcome data for such programs are expected to consist typically of a narrative discussion of the major results achieved by the program during the year, along the following lines:
-Development - the progress of major developmental projects including the results with respect to projects completed or otherwise terminated during the year and the status of projects that will continue.
At the end of 5 years, however, the agency will be able to report the expenses to be categorized as research and development rather than the outlays for each of the preceding 5 years.
• A narrative description of major research and development programs shall be included.
After deliberating the issue, the Board has concluded that additional investigation and further deliberation is required and has directed the FASAB staff to continue to research social insurance issues focusing especially on: identifying the characteristics of programs which should cause them to be subject to the guidance provided in a Statement on Social Insurance; the appropriate display of information in the financial statements; the identification of additional information, if any, which should be required for social insurance programs; the means for measurement of financial data included in such additional information; and, the desirability of nonfinancial indicators (ratios of data to GDP or "covered payroll") to describe the status of programs or the implications of potential changes to or needs of the programs.The Board has instructed the staff to be mindful of all current developments in structuring its research and its recommendations.
The standards require that expense data be reported for investments in human capital, research and development, and nonfederal physical property.
In addition to the normal problems associated with adapting to new standards, several of these standards provide for a transition period during which agencies may or, in some cases, may not report investments in human capital, research and development and nonfederal physical property; if investments are reported for each of five years as called for in this statement, they may be reported for earlier years during the transition period on the basis of either outlays or expense.
Some respondents requested that the standards provide for reporting additional information, such as transfers of stewardship property to foreign governments, stewardship land sold to the private sector, the Federal Government's interest in such things as property held by nonfederal entities or patents generated through Federal research and development funds, and foreign contributions to Federal programs.

As part of its ongoing work in housing issues, GAO has provided assistance to improve the accuracy of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) budget and resource estimates.
GAO's work has led to improvements in many agencies, including the development of entitywide security management practices.
In discussing GAO's contributions and accomplishments, it is important that we engage in a select amount of research and development work to ensure that GAO can meet the institutional needs of the Congress over the long term.
GAO's work on Y2K began through its research and development program, but the vital importance of this issue has manifested itself in many congressional requests for work that the agency received in fiscal years 1998 and 1999.
In fact, the timeline of major events in GAO's existence (see figure 4) reveals the increasing development, complexity and influence of difficult public policy issues related to government activity and our accountability mission:
Nevertheless, GAO is the only agency that can consistently provide the Congress and the executive branch with analysis, options, and recommendations that are long range, broad, in coverage, and integrated in the development and presentation of critical information.
Since I became Comptroller General, one of the most important activities in which GAO has been engaged is the development of its first strategic plan for the 21st century.
GAO worked closely with legislative and committee leadership, individual members, and staff in the development of this strategic plan.
providing analysis and other support concerning the effectiveness of investments in communities and economic development;
And we will create employee pools of generalists to increase our flexibility and enhance development.
GAO has requested funding to improve compensation comparability with the executive branch, strengthen performance reward and recognition programs, reengineer our performance appraisal system, and increase our staff productivity through training and development as well as new information technology resources.
Without GAO's ability to pursue research and development issues, many other consequential issues could go unrecognized and ultimately create fundamental and serious problems for the Congress and the American people.
Thus, I would urge the Congress to not lose sight of the important balance between mandates, requests, and research and development in the mix of GAO's work supporting the Congress.
Department of Housing and Urban Development's budget, including unexpended

During fiscal year 2001, we will continue to focus our work on the major issues facing the Congress, including Social Security solvency, education, economic development, Medicare reform, national security, international affairs, and government management reforms and computer security.
We plan to use these resources to enhance our review efforts in areas of congressional and public interest and concern, such as government computer security, Social Security solvency, education, economic development, Medicare reform, and international affairs.
Contracting for the development of a requirements document to be used along with other legislative branch agencies to jointly procure and share a common financial management system--$250,000.
For example, were it not for the advance research and development work we had done on computer security, China, the World Trade Organization, and last year's presidential election issues, we would have been unable to be responsive to the congressional requests and public debates on these real time, event driven issues.
We need to look at the implications that these differing roles have for a range of issues, such as SES core competencies, performance standards, recruitment sources, mobility, and training and development programs.
Implemented an Executive Candidate Development Program to prepare candidates for assignments in the SES.
Initiated a Professional Development Program for newly hired GAO analysts to help them transition and progress.
In addition, GAO has said the national strategy development and implementation should include 1) a regular update of a national-level threat and risk assessment effort, 2) formulate realistic budget and resource plans to eliminate gaps, avoid duplicate effort, avoid "hitchhiker" spending, and protect against federal funds being used to substitute for funding that would have occurred anyway, 3) coordinate the strategy for combating terrorism with efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to computer-based attacks, 4) coordinate agency implementation by reviewing agency and interagency programs to accomplish the national strategy, and 5) carefully choose the most appropriate policy tools of government to best implement the national strategy and achieve national goals.
Building Partnerships: One of the key challenges of this new department will be the development and maintenance of homeland security partners at all levels of the government and the private sector, both in the United States and overseas.
For example, we have indicated in recent testimony that DHS could serve to improve biomedical research and development coordination because of the current fragmented state of disparate activities.
11 Similarly, we have testified that the President's proposal, in tasking the new department with developing national policy for and coordinating the federal government's research and development efforts for responding to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons threats, also transfers some of the civilian research programs of the Department of Energy.

"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county," said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. "
Competitive bidding also became easier with a reputation to back up his grant proposals, and Dudovitz soon was raising enough to develop slick promotional materials and to share funds with other public interest programs to cement collaborative efforts on health care, policy advocacy, homelessness, domestic-violence assistance, self-help and technology development.
Under the Department of Housing and Urban Development' enforcement program, tenants may not avoid eviction simply by claiming ignorance of the crime or an inability to stop it.
"I think if it's done with caution, it's a tool that we desperately needed in our developments," Sanchez said.
Once the development is taken over, it's very difficult to take them back."
In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution.
Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns.
At stake is prime real estate in the coastal cities, including a Charleston building in the heart of upscale commercial development on upper King Street.
It recommends adding to the access fund, increasing both the number of pro bono hours and financial contributions from attorneys, improved assistance for unrepresented litigants and access to an attorney for those who require one, and development of a statewide plan to distribute legal services more evenly throughout the state to insure that the rural population also is served.
Since 1990, she has worked in the Administrative Law Unit and Resource Development, and directed the Elder Law Project, serving the northern half of the state.
The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana.
There are pro bono programs that now partner with volunteer corporate lawyers to assist not-for-profits and micro-enterprises as well as on economic development projects.

While gaining access to justice is their first priority, most legal-aid organizations put marketing and development on the back burner.
Julia C. Langfelder began her job as the development coordinator for the Center for Conflict Resolution about a year ago.
In the suit, NLS attorney Eileen D. Yacknin and Evalynn B. Welling, Community Justice Project attorney, contend that the city is trying to avoid its responsibilities to the tenants under state eminent domain code and the federal Housing and Community Development Act by having Raimondi carry out the evictions.
"At the same time, the federal government's role in representing the nation in its regulation, policy development and oversight responsibilities demands the most skilled lawyers," the report added. "
The project is funded by a two-year, $80,000 fellowship from the nonprofit Academy for Educational Development, along with grants of $37,500 each from the Spirit Mountain Community Fund and the Campaign for Equal Justice, and a grant of $12,500 from the PacifiCorp Foundation for Learning.
The most tangible evidence of this effort was the development of bar-sponsored pro bono programs in every state, in every sizable metropolitan area, and in many rural areas as well.

Therefore, it simultaneously established a separate, independent Postal Rate Commission to provide an open process in which the public could participate in the development of postage rates.
§ 504(a) authorized the Postmaster General to maintain a research and development program, and to conduct experiments to enhance the operational efficiency and economy of the postal system.
Mr. Annan stressed the importance of reducing the inequalities in science between developed and developing countries, asserting that “This unbalanced distribution of scientific activity generates serious problems not only for the scientific community in the developing countries, but for development itself.”
For example, recent United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) estimates (UNESCO 2001) indicate that, in 1997, the developed countries accounted for some 84% of the global investment in scientific research and development, had approximately 72% of the world researchers, and produced approximately 88% of all scientific and technical publications registered by the Science Citation Index (SCI).
More relevant measurements for these factors include the proportional change in the number of publications and the total number of publications when corrected for investment in research and development (May 1997).
Further analyses, correcting the number of overall publications for the amount of money invested in research and development for each region, also show that, in contrast to both Canada and United States, the trend in Latin America has been an increase in relative output throughout the 1990s (Figure 2).
Although the cost of research is undoubtedly cheaper in the developing world due to relatively low researcher salaries, overhead and other work standards, these factors do not explain the substantial increase in the number of publications per amount of money allocated to research and development in Latin America, particularly from 1995 until 2000 (Figure 2).
In fact, Albornoz (2001) concluded that, as a group, Latin America could afford to invest a much higher proportion of its resources in scientific research and development.
Latin American investment in research and development represented only 0.59% of the regional GDP in 1998, a very weak effort compared with that of the United States (2.
For example, Uruguay, Chile, Panama, and Cuba averaged, respectively, 6.8, 5.3, 5.2, and 3.4 publications per million dollars of research and development investment in the 10 years studied, which is notoriously high compared with United States (1.
Other countries, such as Costa Rica, Cuba, Brazil, and Chile, have invested a much greater proportion of their GDP in research and development than the other countries of this region (Albornoz 2001).
Why has the number of publications per dollar invested in research and development been increasing in Latin America while decreasing in United States and Canada?
One potential explanation for the increase in scientific productivity in Latin America is that scientific development during the 1990s was particularly strong for many countries of this region.
A potentially more important question, however, is why the number of publications per dollar invested in research and development has been increasing in Latin America while decreasing in the United States and Canada.
The relative increase in the number of publications, especially when corrected for the amount of money available in research and development, demonstrates that many developing countries are heading in the right direction.
Sinclair expects to see such developments within his lifetime, but he ridicules the notion that humans will experience anything like the 70% extension to lifespan of his cultured yeast.
Mathematical models, he says, could solve it by linking demographic properties and physiological developments.
In a further development, two independent groups determined the molecular structure of an MPN + /JAMM protein from an archaebacterium (Ambroggio et al.
Individuals within a wild population show remarkably little morphological variation, given the amount of environmental variation they encounter during development and the amount of genetic variation within the population.
In the lab, RNAi is routinely used to reveal the genetic secrets of development, intracellular signaling, cancer, infection, and a full range of other phenomena.
“There was a lot of clinical naïveté” in the early days of antisense and ribozymes, according to Nassim Usman, Vice President for Research and Development at Sirna Therapeutics in Boulder, Colorado.
“The fundamental difference favoring RNAi is that we're harnessing an endogenous, natural pathway,” says Nagesh Mahanthappa, Director of Corporate Development at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the second of two major biotech company developing RNAi-based therapy.
Despite the questions and unsolved problems, Sirna, Alnylam, and several other companies are moving ahead to develop RNAi therapy; indeed, some outstanding questions are probably only likely to be answered in the process of therapeutic development.
Following the development of penicillin for the treatment of septicemia in the early 1940s, numerous antibiotics were discovered and introduced into medicine.
In marine invertebrates, chimeric individuals often arise from the fusion of individuals later in development (Buss 1987).
During embryonic development, bacteria move from the mother's bacteriome into the cells of the embryo's bacteriome.
Stuttering subjects as a group differ from fluent control groups by showing, on average, slightly lower intelligence scores on both verbal and nonverbal tasks and by delays in speech development (Andrews et al.
It is possible that all children who show signs of stuttering develop a structural abnormality during development, but this is transient in those who become fluent speakers.
The AIDS crisis has brought to public notice what has always been generally true—that the existing business model for drug development leads to high prices and unequal access.
Today's high drug prices are a direct consequence of a business model that uses a single payment to cover both the cost of manufacture of a drug and the cost of the research and development (R&D) carried out by manufacturers to discover it.
Propping up the present structure for financing R&D (Figure 2A) is the widely held belief that the private sector plays a key role in the development of new medicines and that it is necessary to grant patents to incentivise private-sector financing.
The existing system (Figure 2A), despite its failings, does lead to the development of new drugs.
The challenge in creating a virtual R&D market is to find viable business models for successful drug development in the absence of marketing monopoly incentives.
One obvious approach is direct funding of drug development.
For example, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the national agency in the United States, already spends $27 billion per year on research, a substantial amount of which is directed towards drug development, including clinical trials.
Governments could expand direct funding for drug development, either through the existing structures in academia or through funding R&D arms of existing companies to carry out specific drug R&D.
Such directed drug development funding could be similar to existing nonprofit development projects, such as those currently resourced to address treatments for neglected diseases like malaria and tuberculosis (TB).
Such directed drug development funding could be similar to existing nonprofit development projects, such as those currently resourced to address treatments for neglected diseases like malaria and tuberculosis (TB).
Examples of such projects are the Medicines for Malaria Venture (www.mmv.org), the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (www.tballiance.org), the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (www.iavi.org), the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (Butler 2003b) (www.dndi.org), and the Institute for One World Health (www.oneworldhealth.org).
Many will also worry that a centralised national drug development agency taking decisions on R&D priorities and allocation of funds (via prizes or grants as discussed above) could easily become bureaucratic and inefficient.
Intermediators would compete to attract funds to invest in R&D on the basis of their prowess for drug development and upon their priorities.
The basic research was done under a grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the United States Department of Defense's (DOD) central research and development organization, and once the researchers realized they wanted to develop drugs against three agents that have been considered bioterrorism threats — 
The bottleneck, researchers agree, lies in the development process of turning them into effective therapies.
“It's easier to find inhibitors of particular enzymes for particular processes—and a very long road to convert that into something for development.”
8 yards) thick that had become susceptible to burning in swampy forests drained and cleared for development.
We will concentrate on human studies that enhance our understanding of disease epidemiology, etiology, and physiology; the development of prognostic and diagnostic technologies; and trials that test the efficacy of specific interventions and those that compare different treatments.
Developments in endosymbiosis are important not only to questions in basic research, but may have important practical applications.
Blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes and tsetse flies are vectors for parasites that cause significant global infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue virus, and trypanosomiasis, many of which have frustrated attempts at vaccine development.
Moreover, the field has expanded rapidly, especially since the development of molecular techniques in the past two to three decades.
For example, the absence of eyes in cavefish, rather than being the result of a degenerative process, might be the result of selection on genes that govern feeding morphology, a selection process that has included suppression of eye development (Pennisi 2002).
There is no reason for animals with a development as slow as a baboon (with adulthood achieved in five or six years) not to be influenced in every way by the environment in which they grow up, including the social environment.
In the wake of declarations supporting open access to research literature from international bodies including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations' World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), advocates and critics of the movement appear to have agreed that the issue warrants a robust, ongoing dialogue—a development undoubtedly in the interest of the scientific community, regardless of its ultimate outcome.

This council will keep us apprised of new developments and give our nation a forum to continue to discuss and evaluate these important issues.”
On the other hand, we were grateful that the President, despite his views in opposition to these therapies, was willing to invite serious biomedical scientists to help formulate advice to him—and ultimately to contribute to the development of national policy—on these critically important advances.
to illustrate the process, it is because it accompanies an article in this issue of PLoS Biology dealing with neural development in this species (Kuroda et al.
development initially discovered its role in mesoderm induction and the formation of posterior tissues (Kimelman et al.
2000), and their eloquent exposition (Streit and Stern 1999; Wilson and Edlund 2001; Stern 2002) to turn the tide, but there is now no doubt that the FGF signaling pathway plays a major role in the specification and early development of the neural ectoderm in chordates.
The time delay in Churchill induction appears to be the key in explaining how one signal, FGF, can be involved in mesodermal and neural development at the same time in cells that are in close proximity.
Present in plants, animals, and many fungi, RNA-mediated gene silencing pathways have essential roles in development, chromosome structure, and virus resistance.
miRNAs are now recognized as key regulators of plant and animal development.

Such changes in social behaviour are often based on facial expression and come so naturally to humans (and are in place so early in child development) that some might argue that this functionality is essentially innate.
One reason for my increased use of research papers is the development of PDFs.

Furthermore, I accomplish two tasks simultaneously: I keep abreast of new developments in my field and I write exam questions.
These developments occurred among the early hunter-gatherer human cultures and continued through the last ice age.
This modest increase in the input from the peripheral auditory receptors provides little basis for the development of human speech and language, which had much more to do with the increase in the central brain mechanisms that elaborate the input.
This book, the latest in the excellent Monographs in Population Biology series from Princeton University Press, is a work of advocacy in which the authors argue that evolutionary theory is incomplete and that, in consequence, we are failing fully to understand phenomena as disparate as ecosystem development and the interplay of genes and culture in shaping human evolution.
Yet recently, the European Union awarded 12 million Euros to the ZF-MODELS research consortium to study zebrafish models for human development and disease.
It was the late 1960s when phage geneticist George Streisinger began to look for a model system in which to study the genetic basis of vertebrate neural development.
neural development but soon became attracted to zebrafish as a model organism.
By the early 1980s, she explains, Streisinger had worked out many of the genetic tricks needed to tackle zebrafish development.
‘You can see different cell types, watch individual cells develop, do transplantation experiments’, Eisen enthuses, ‘and development is quick but not too quick’.
The properties of zebrafish that attracted Eisen soon attracted people interested in other aspects of vertebrate development to the stripy tiddler (Figure 1).
The aim of both screens was to identify genes with unique and essential functions in zebrafish development, and in 1996 an issue of the journal Development was dedicated to the mutants that had been isolated and characterised.

‘From Wolfgang's lab, I was able to take the mutations that affected notochord development, and have been studying them ever since’.
The notochord is an embryonic structure that forms the primitive axial skeleton of the developing embryo, and because mutations affecting notochord development result in shortened embryos, seven of the affected genes have been named after the dwarves in Snow White—zebrafish, like some other developmental models, have many imaginatively named mutants.
The ZF-MODELS consortium, which is funded under the European Union's Sixth Framework Programme, aims to establish zebrafish models for human diseases, discover genes that will lead to the identification of new drug targets, and gain fundamental insights into human development.
For example, Geisler's lab will use DNA chip technology to investigate gene expression patterns in zebrafish mutants and so provide increased knowledge of the regulatory pathways that act in zebrafish development.
Among the genes that are important in notochord development are those that encode laminins.
This, in combination with other work on zebrafish carrying mutations affecting neural development, will give the team ‘a better picture of how a vertebrate brain is built’.
But how much can zebrafish tell us about human development and disease?
‘Of course, there are developmental differences between people and fish, and no one pretends that we can answer every question about human development in zebrafish’.
Hopkins provides the following illustration: ‘We have been doing “shelf screens”, in which we go back to our collection of mutants to find all those that affect the development of a single organ.
Developmental geneticist Didier Stainier (University of California, San Francisco, California, United States) is also using zebrafish to study organ development, in particular, heart development.
Developmental geneticist Didier Stainier (University of California, San Francisco, California, United States) is also using zebrafish to study organ development, in particular, heart development.
‘Obviously, there are additional processes involved in humans, but the basic outline of heart development in fish and people is largely similar’.
The ability to follow individual cells as organs develop is key to this, says Stainier, who reported in March that fibronectin is required for heart development because, by regulating the polarisation of epithelial cells, fibronectin ensures the correct migration of myocardial cells.
The interest in disease models has grown hand-in-hand with the development of morpholinos to knock out specific genes, and the advent of TILLING, says Zon, ‘has set off a whole new fury.
Work like Stainier's on organ development may have applications in tissue engineering.
And while many zebrafish researchers will continue to study development, others are now moving into the realms of physiology and behavioural studies.
The ZFIN Web site, at http://z.n.org/ZFIN, provides an extensive database for the zebrafish community including genetic, genomic, and developmental information; search engines for zebrafish researchers and laboratories; listings of meetings; and links to many other zebrafish sites, including sites with movies of zebrafish development.
The special issue of Development (Dec 1; 1996; 123: 1–461) on the first two mutagenesis screens contains 37 research articles and can be freely accessed at http://dev.biologists.org/content/vol123/issue1/index.shtml
It's not just a matter of developing the imaging technology, he stresses—“we'll need fundamental developments in semantics, too.”
Those societies that embrace the developments taking place in scholarly publishing may well see their membership and publications thrive more than societies that cling to the potentially unstable status quo.
‘In doing so, the ERC should create and support nodes of excellence in European universities and research institutions, strengthening the knowledge-base that underpins economic, industrial, cultural and societal development, and thereby stimulating European competitiveness and innovative capacity at all levels.
Another example comes from the study of morphogen gradient formation in animal development.

The first paper (Halpin and Harbury 2004a) reports the development of resin-linked oligonucleotides that efficiently and sequence-specifically capture DNA containing complementary subsequences.
In lines bombarded late in plant development, triggering of silencing was rarely observed.
However, when the transgene was introduced earlier in development, a large portion of the lines showed a substantial decrease and eventually full suppression of the chitinase mRNA levels.
The individual parts of a whole plant are, in terms of import and export, in an equilibrium that changes with development.
tadpoles are unable to regenerate their tails during a refractory period of development between stages 45 and 47 (Beck et al.
The programme goes into some detail about what is now known about the molecular basis of normal and abnormal development, and how we can begin to explain such extraordinary forms as that of the Parodi twins, who had distinct heads and shoulders, but merged into a single torso and a single pair of legs.
On another research track, using functional imaging, Ralph-Axel Müller, a cognitive neuroscientist at San Diego State University (San Diego, California, United States) sees a scattering of brain activation in autistic brains that he views as an indication of a more general brain development problem underlying the disorder (Figure 1).
Animal models may, in turn, yield clues about normal and abnormal brain development in humans.
Research focuses have shifted from “curing” autism to finding better diagnostics for early intervention, improving behavioral therapies, and gaining insight into the development and function of the autistic brain.
At the 2004 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (Washington DC, United States), the UW center director Geraldine Dawson explained that this tackling of specific deficits will help researchers attach them to particular “mind modules” in the brain and will ultimately lead to the genes that control the development or function of those modules.
That modular view, however, is not shared by many of her colleagues elsewhere, who argue that autistic behaviors are the result of a system-wide perturbation of early brain development and connectivity.
The team hypothesizes that these skills, which normal children pick up easily and early, lay important groundwork for language development.
A detailed and comparative view of the genetic mechanisms underlying their host defense will contribute to the identification of new targets for insecticide development, and provide opportunities for controlling the transmission of pathogens.
In the mid 1990s, the United States Agency for International Development was investing more than $2 billion a year in 105 conservation projects with an ecotourism component.
Similarly, between 1988 and 2003, the World Bank funded 55 development projects that supported protected areas in Africa, 32 of which placed an emphasis on ecotourism.
‘Much of the information about community-based ecotourism is anecdotal and subjective,’ says Agnes Kiss of the Environment and Social Development Unit at the World Bank.
It could also bring far greater development benefits than indirect financial support, he says (Box 2).
An additional spin-off is that direct payments force conservation biologists to quantify and hence clarify their objectives, says John Hough, principal technical advisor on biodiversity for the United Nations Development Programme.
Plant growth and development involves the integration of many environmental and endogenous signals that, together with the intrinsic genetic program, determine plant form.
This group includes auxin, cytokinin, the gibberellins (GAs), abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, the brassinosteroids (BRs), and jasmonic acid (JA), each of which acts at low concentrations to regulate many aspects of plant growth and development.
Virtually every aspect of plant growth and development is under hormonal control to some degree.
More recently, the isolation of hormone biosynthetic and response mutants has provided powerful new tools for painting a clearer picture of the roles of the various phytohormones in plant growth and development.
Molecular and biochemical analysis of the gene products defined by these mutations, coupled with expression studies aimed at identifying the downstream target genes that mediate hormonal changes in growth and development, has begun to unlock some of the mysteries behind phytohormone action.
One of the main themes of the book is the evolutionary approach and the importance of biological structures and properties that were co-opted in the development of language (pre-adaptations).
While the identity of the yield gene conferring the phenotype was not critical to the success of the cultivar development scheme described by Zamir and Gur (2004), there is great curiosity to understand the gene(s) or genes and genetic mechanisms that underlie traits of interest to agriculture.
Because the approach is primarily useful for self-pollinating species (as opposed to cross-pollinators), variety development can go forward with the expectation that new varieties can be developed and distributed as inbred strains.
Moreover, functional genomics support the concept that skeletal muscle remodeling to a ST phenotype, either through activated calcineurin or PPARδ, can protect against the development of dietary-induced insulin resistance (Ryder et al.
After months of often dizzying rhetoric from virtually all camps, one concrete development has indisputably emerged from the fray: governments around the world have begun to take an interest in the question of who can and can't read the results of the scientific research they fund.
Proponents envisage development of a comprehensive database of sequences, preferably associated with voucher specimens representing described species, against which sequences from sampled individuals can be compared.
He created, against what must have been considerable obstacles, the first widely successful PDA, and continued the development of this platform.
Crucially, over the course of the development of unsupervised learning methods, it has been realised that the best way to approach the extraction of input structure, and inference with it, is through the language and tools of probability theory and statistics.
The same realisation has driven substantial developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and a host of other disciplines.
It is postulated that tissue injury by these reactive oxygen species accumulates over a long period of time and plays roles in the aging process and the development of heart disease, diabetes, chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and several neurodegenerative diseases (Halliwell 1999).
The degree of the development of these isolating mechanisms is roughly proportional to the genetic distance between the populations, reflecting the fact that incompatibilities accumulate over time (Coyne and Orr 1989).
In recent years, exciting developments have started to take place in the analysis of the genetics of reinforcement (reviewed in Servedio and Noor 2003).
These developments both parallel and overlap with progress made on the genetics of speciation and species differences in general.
This leads to the novel conclusion that reinforcement is not just increasing the strength of an already existing mechanism of species discrimination, but is occurring through the development of a new discrimination system.
These kinds of developments can also motivate more realistic theoretical models of the reinforcement process.
Generalizations of single linear equations to families of simultaneous multi-variable linear equations stimulated the development of linear algebra and the European re-invention and naming of matrices in the mid-19th century.
Many of these developments blend smoothly into their antecedents and later elaborations.
For example, game theory has a history before the work of John von Neumann (von Neumann 1959; von Neumann and Morgenstern 1953), and Karl Pearson's development of the correlation coefficient (Pearson and Lee 1903) rested on earlier work by Francis Galton (1889).
Beginning in the 1980s, general principles began to emerge about the evolution of development in animals.
and the subsequent discovery of their conservation and similar expression in different Metazoans led to the revolutionary realization that many of the mechanisms critical to basic animal development have been conserved across more than 500 million years of evolution.
However, though critical for development and reproduction, the mechanisms that specify sex determination are among the least-conserved known.
There are also systems in which heterozygosity at a single locus is required for female development (known as complementary sex determination; [3]), as well as systems involving sex determination via multiple genes with additive effects.
Soon, related doublesex-mab-3 (DM)-family genes with roles in male sexual development were discovered in vertebrates and even cnidarians [7,8].
, the first gene to respond to the X:A ratio is Sxl , whose transcription is regulated by both autosomal and X-linked factors very early in development [4,13].
Later in development, transcription from a second promoter occurs in both sexes, but these transcripts cannot be productively spliced without the earlier burst of Sxl expression.
Though the divergence is extreme, it is likely that a better understanding of the evolution of sex determination genes and pathways holds lessons about the evolution of development in general.
Presumably, the atlas will be a boon for drug discovery and development by providing information on drug targets present within brain cells.
The mouse is a young adult at 56 days old, free from the confounding factors of development.

The American S&E labor pool is shrinking, and industry has already responded by transferring much of its research and development overseas; however, companies are mostly moving lab scientists, not strategic analysts.
Herzer, for one, now a technology development representative at the Scripps Research Institute, has staked his future on the potential of professional master's degrees.
You're the director of one of the world's largest medical research charities, and you receive notification from one of your funded investigators in Africa reporting some exciting progress toward the development of a vaccine for malaria.
However, the Trust considers that the development of a PubMed Central portal in the UK offers the best next step in the transition towards a situation where all high-quality peer-reviewed research is available for free via the Internet, whilst leaving all publishers room for manoeuvre in this changing market.
For two decades, the bulk of our knowledge of molecular pathways that guide cardiac growth, development, and disease has been gleaned from a combination of in vivo studies in genetically engineered mice and primary cultures of neonatal and adult rat cardiomyocytes.
The development of well-characterized cardiac progenitor cells offers the promise of using real genetic-based approaches to rapidly define the complex pathways that guide cardiac contractility, excitability, and lineage diversification into atrial, ventricular, and conduction system myocyte cell lineages.
The likelihood that he had heard of these scientific developments seems remote, particularly in view of the fact that Andy Warhol was following the same track of using cartoon material, reputedly in mutual ignorance of Lichtenstein's breakthrough.
Similar phenomena have been predicted in other sensory modalities [19,41], but remain to be shown directly by exposing different individuals to different environments during development.
MMP12 deficiency has been shown to protect mice against emphysema after chronic exposure to cigarette smoke, implying that MMP12 may be the key proteinase in the development of emphysema in this species [49,50].
Aside from efforts to prevent smoking or encourage cessation, there exist no measures that prevent development of emphysema or treat the specific causes of airway obstruction.
According to a recent Institute of Medicine report, and a study sponsored by the US Agency for International Development, the number of health care workers in many African countries is actually shrinking as they are lured to developed countries by better pay and professional opportunities (Box 1) [2,3].
Both during surgical training and in the early years of faculty development, surgeons must obtain a thorough grounding in the principles of basic research and proper clinical investigation.
To help correct for this worrisome trend, the NIH created the “K” award system—career development grants designed to help starting researchers gain the experience needed to compete for RO1 grants.
Locally, and individually, surgeons must join efforts to improve the clinical research enterprise by including training in clinical investigation at an early stage in medical school and during surgical residency training, fostering the careers of young surgeon-investigators through committed, protected time, participating in local and national clinical research groups, and recognizing that development as a clinical researcher takes time—many years in fact.
In the brain, glucocerebroside arises from the turnover of complex lipids during brain development and the formation of the myelin sheath of nerves.
The development of enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease, that is, exogenous administration of the missing enzyme, is a triumph of translational medicine.
This led to the development of a modified enzyme, processed to expose mannose, and to its production on an industrial scale from placentas.
The quality of life for patients with Gaucher disease has been greatly improved by the development of enzyme replacement therapy.
This profitability has served as a stimulus for the development of enzyme replacement treatments for diseases less common and generally less responsive to treatment than Gaucher disease.
Short synthetic peptides are ideal for drug development because of the relatively low cost of production, easy storage, and high safety.
The development of such responses, however, requires a large tumor load, occurs late in the disease, and probably does not cause the efficient destruction of the tumor cells [4].
The successful use of HAART is limited by drug-related toxicities, high costs, and drug resistance [3], factors which have led to the development of alternative therapeutic strategies, including the use of supervised, or structured, treatment interruption (STI).
This study raises important questions in our understanding of HIV pathogenesis, treatment, and vaccine development.
Finally, is this good or bad news for HIV vaccine development?
This format will allow the development of better tools to help clinicians apply trial results to their practice.
Publicly accessible trial databases (such as the Trial Bank Project at http://rctbank.ucsf.edu) are under development.
The idea of enlisting the immune system to fight cancer has been around for a long time, and has led to the development of various cancer vaccines designed to alert the immune system to the presence of a tumor and to induce a response that, selectively and potently, will eliminate tumor cells.
While patent incentives and commercial pharmaceutical houses have made Western health care the envy of the world, the commercial model only works if companies can sell enough patented products to cover their research and development (R&D) costs.
The second involves charities creating nonprofit venture-capital firms (“Virtual Pharmas”), which look for promising drug candidates and then push drug development through contracts with corporate partners.
In this article, we discuss the limitations of these two approaches and suggest a third, “open source,” approach to drug development, called the Tropical Diseases Initiative (TDI).
Virtual Pharmas have clearly started to bear fruit, and are responsible for most candidate treatments for tropical diseases currently under development.
For example, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative has a portfolio of nine projects spread out across the drug development pipeline for the treatment of leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, and malaria [6].
Second, Virtual Pharma's development pipelines will run dry without more upstream research.
We expect sponsors to exploit this advantage by signing development contracts with whichever company offers the lowest bid.
A successful program must (1) make a significant contribution toward supplying the genomic insights that tropical disease research needs to move forward, and (2) make useful drug candidates available for development and production under open-source licenses.
Is it possible, then, that sleep-related changes in leptin and ghrelin influence the development of metabolic and immune disorders?
These changes can be hypothesized to play a contributory, rather than compensatory, role in the development of overweight and obesity with sleep restriction.
(3) Patients were also withdrawn as therapy failures if (a) the CD4 cell number declined by more than 45% of the baseline CD4 count, (b) participants developed an opportunistic infection, even if retaining required CD4 count levels, or (c) a viral load of greater than 500,000 copies/ml occurred once, with or without development of acute retroviral syndrome as defined by fever, skin lesions, and pharyngitis.
It is of interest to note that despite the large amount of research activity on TIs in patients with suppressed chronic infection and the hundreds of monitored interruptions studied to date, only limited cases of development of clinical resistance (as evidenced by a lack of viral resuppression following therapy reinitiation) have emerged, in contrast to the multiple reports of detection of viral sequences off ART associated with resistance as shown in this study and others [11,19,29,30,39,40].
The development [15,16] and clinical introduction of lymphotropic magnetic nanoparticles has been shown to significantly improve diagnostic accuracies of MRI for nodal staging (LMRI) in prostate cancer [17].
Our findings have a number of direct implications for technology development and in clinical care.
The aim of this new funding body, which has a budget of &euro;400 million spread over five years, is a noble one: to fund research in developing countries, particularly in Africa, that contributes to the development of affordable prophylactics and drugs for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.
Therefore, there is a clear need for "capacity building"—development of a research infrastructure, in terms of both equipment and personnel, that is capable of coping with the challenges of clinical trials.
Acquired resistance to coccidioidomycosis strongly correlates with the development of a delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test response to coccidioidal antigens [23] and the production of T-helper-1 (Th1)-associated cytokines to coccidioidal antigens, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) [24].
As previously mentioned, recovery from disease confers lifelong immunity to reinfection, and is a rationale for the development and implementation of a vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic or serious forms of the disease.
A candidate vaccine comprised of a fusion protein based on two antigens has been selected and is currently in pharmaceutical development under the sponsorship of this project, with the goal of evaluating the safety and immunogenicity in humans.
So far, we have little evidence that mental practice will help prevent the development of dementia.
We have better evidence that good brain health is multiply determined, that brain development early in life matters, and that genetic influences are of great importance in accounting for individual differences in cognitive reserve and in explaining who develops Alzheimer disease and who does not.
The passage of the Bayh–Dole Act in 1980 enabled universities to license inventions for commercial development [3].
Therefore, universities have an incentive to advance the clinical development of inventions by their faculty.
The incremental gain in safety is likely to be small (particularly if oversight is well established), while the decrease in speed of development will be significant.
The protective effects of antibody to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides have been appreciated since the development of serum therapy, in which passively transferred, serotype-specific antipneumococcal serum reduced mortality from pneumococcal pneumonia by half [1].
The development of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines for adults [2] and the efficacy of pneumococcal polysaccharide–protein conjugate vaccines in infants and children [3,4] have confirmed that active immunity to the polysaccharide can provide excellent protection against invasive disease from pneumococci of the same serotype, and in some cases protection against cross-reacting serotypes within the same serogroup.
While the ability of passive or vaccine-induced anticapsular antibodies to protect against pneumococcal disease is clear, less is known about the natural development of immunity to pneumococcal disease in unimmunized persons.
As we discuss below, each of these lines of evidence is subject to caveats, but we believe that, taken together, these observations make a strong case for the importance of one or more factors other than acquisition of anticapsular antibodies in the development of protection against pneumococcal disease.
A better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie natural immunity to pneumococcus could pave the way for the development of more effective, species-specific pneumococcal vaccines.
Recent developments in HIV treatment, with simple combination therapies priced at less than US$150 per year—unthinkable just a short time ago—were a major driver of discussions during the conference.
Subsequent development of vaccines based on the bacterium's polysaccharide capsule, which could protect against infection, confirmed that an endogenous antibody response can provide protection against invasive disease.
One challenge for vaccine development has been the existence of many different serotypes (the same species of bacteria but with different composition of the polysaccharide capsule).
The study doesn't demonstrate what the additional components are, but additional research might not just teach us about our immune system but also provide clues for further vaccine development.
As the authors say, “A better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie natural immunity to pneumococcus could pave the way for the development of more effective, species-specific pneumococcal vaccines.”
We must focus on the development of training, monitoring, and quality assurance systems that ensure that prevention and care are integrated whenever possible.
It may be timely to address the prevention of diabetes in patients with metabolic syndrome since these patients are at high risk for development of type 2 diabetes.
Failing to comply with lifestyle modification, his weight has increased 7 lb in two years and likely contributes to his development of diabetes.
Tight glycemic control can slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy (Figures 1–3) [9] and help prevent development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
There is an association between metabolic syndrome and the development of CVD and type 2 diabetes [13].
The effect of this hyperinsulinemic state in metabolic syndrome is also believed to be involved in excess pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic markers associated with the development of diabetes and CVD [15].
Free community science was inspired by the free software movement, which itself was inspired by the application of the ideal of scientific cooperation, as it was applied to software development by the operating system developers of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Artificial Intelligence Lab in the 1970s.
Critical neurodevelopmental processes occur in the human central nervous system during fetal development and in the first three years of life.
Environmental toxins covertly enter a child's body transplacentally during fetal development or by direct ingestion of house dust, soil, and breastmilk and other dietary sources during early childhood [51,52,53,54,55,56].
The structure and development of the cerebral cortex of animals commonly used in these studies differs markedly from that of humans.
Results of the pilot experiences were reported at a final conference in December 2004 and will form the basis of European recommendations on migrant-friendliness as a quality criterion for hospital development and on the role of hospitals in promoting health and health literacy for migrants and ethnic minorities.
Indeed, in the absence of comprehensive economic development, the impact of sanitation, footwear, and health education has been minimal [19].

Given that hookworm afflicts only the world's most impoverished, a major hurdle for the development of the Na -ASP-2 Hookworm Vaccine is its small commercial market.
This approach might help to inform the development of business models for the production and distribution of orphan biologics for other neglected diseases.
In addition, an understanding of the molecular signaling events that drive the beneficial effects of exercise on human physiology could foster the development of novel drugs, devices, or biological agents designed to substitute for exercise.
Patterning of skeletal muscle fiber composition is initially determined during embryonic development, but can be partially or completely overturned by stimuli applied to fully mature adult myofibers: by hormonal influences (e.g.
The starting point for the development of a human-rights based policy on mental health is that mentally ill individuals are full human beings who are entitled to rights.
MDRI has documented how European governments, development banks and international humanitarian relief organizations fund projects to build new psychiatric institutions and orphanages throughout the Americas and Eastern Europe, rather than focusing on community care [9].
Nonetheless, studies presented here provide a basis for the rational development of “second generation” kinase inhibitors for use in NSCLC.
0020075), the initial identification three years ago of resistance mutations against imatinib led to the rapid development of alternative kinase inhibitors that work even against tumors with the resistance mutation.
Although there are many potential mechanisms for development of clinical resistance, most cases of imatinib-resistant CML are due to point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain itself, including T315I [10,11].
Pao and colleagues' superb study also highlights several important points that may guide development of kinase-targeted therapies in the future.
This proactive approach should shorten the time frame for new drug development.
avß3 integrin has a role in cell migration and extravasation, which occurs during metastasis, and also in angiogenesis—the development of new blood vessels that are essential for the growth of tumors.
In the research paper in PLoS Medicine , Haubner and colleagues take the development of the compound further towards clinical application.
The prevalence of asthma and allergy has risen in all industrialized countries during recent decades, and there is much debate about exposure to pets in early life and later development of asthma and allergy.
Where does this finding leave patients who might wonder about exposure to cats and the development of allergy?
Nowhere is this more true than in medicine, where the suffering of our patients underpins our scientific inquiry, our clinical development, and our personal growth as healers.
A human rights approach to health information systems also supports effective health development.
The development group of HMN recently considered strategies for strengthening health information systems within countries.
Therefore, the public release of equity-oriented information on health should be explicitly planned for in the development of health information systems.
The HMN Equity Working Group suggests development of international standards for collection and sharing of disaggregated data and its use.
The initial development stage of the HMN has now ended, and hopefully the refinement and implementation stages of the effort will begin within the next year.
The availability of human neural progenitor cells allowed us to investigate whether inductive signals involved in normal pathways of islet development could direct these neural progenitors to develop into glucose-responsive IPCs.
We used human insulin cDNA (320 bp) cloned in plasmid pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) as a template for in vitro transcription to produce riboprobes with a digoxigenin-RNA labeling kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas, United States), performed hybridization with IPC cluster sections as described [16], and used DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States) for development according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Glucose Restriction Initiates IPC Development
Thus, we postulated that glucose reduction might blunt neurogenic programs by NSs and promote alternate fates, including development of IPCs.
Therefore, we switched NS culture conditions from high glucose (37 mM, “stage 1”) to low glucose (5 mM, “stage 2”; see Figure 1A) to initiate development.
We also detected increased expression of Neurogenin3 (ngn3) (see Figure 1C), a transcription factor expressed in differentiating neurons, and required for development of pancreatic islet progenitor cells [24,25,26].
RA Promotes IPC Development
RA induces development of primitive endodermal cells from a subset of embryonal carcinoma cell lines, and is an endogenous signal that directs development of posterior organs like the pancreas from embryonic endoderm [27,28].
RA induces development of primitive endodermal cells from a subset of embryonal carcinoma cell lines, and is an endogenous signal that directs development of posterior organs like the pancreas from embryonic endoderm [27,28].
In vivo exposure to RA is sufficient to induce ectopic development of insulin-expressing tissue in the anterior foregut [27].
To investigate whether RA could stimulate development of NS-derived cells toward an IPC fate, we measured expression of Pdx1, Cdx1, and FoxA3, transcription factors that regulate gastrointestinal organ development [29,30].
To investigate whether RA could stimulate development of NS-derived cells toward an IPC fate, we measured expression of Pdx1, Cdx1, and FoxA3, transcription factors that regulate gastrointestinal organ development [29,30].
Thus, higher doses of RA induced markers of posterior fate in NS-derived cells, a dosage response like that seen during RA patterning of posterior gut development in vivo.
By contrast, mesoderm development invariably accompanies endoderm development in embryoid bodies derived from human ES cells or embryonic germ cells [31,32,33].
By contrast, mesoderm development invariably accompanies endoderm development in embryoid bodies derived from human ES cells or embryonic germ cells [31,32,33].
RA can activate signaling through the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, and recent studies show that Hh signals control development of embryonic pancreatic islets in vivo [16,34].
To elucidate the mechanisms underlying RA-induced expression of markers like FoxA3 and Pdx1, we examined Hh signaling during IPC development.
At 300 nM, a dose used to induce neuronal development in ES cell cultures [21], Shh produced a significant increase in neurite outgrowth in NS-derived cells (Figure 3D and 3E; see Methods), and resulted in increased Ptc expression (Figure 3F).
These data are reminiscent of prior studies demonstrating that excess endodermal Shh signaling disrupts pancreas development in vivo [16,34].
ngn3, Pdx1, and Hb9 are essential factors for mammalian β-cell development [22], and their expression in stage 3 suggested the potential for deriving IPCs.
Thus, reduction of glucose in stage 2 growth medium followed by a later increase in glucose at stage 3 or 4 was essential for development of IPCs.
Our study shows that application of endogenous signals governing pancreas development to human neural progenitor cells can generate glucose-responsive IPCs.
Further experimentation may elucidate the basis for these differences, revealing the extent of neural progenitor cell development toward an endocrine cell fate.
Recent studies suggest that neural cells can be derived from adult pancreatic epithelium [7,8], adding to a growing body of data demonstrating numerous similarities in neural and pancreatic endocrine development (reviewed in [43]).
Nevertheless, compared to other methods for IPC development from human stem cells [13,44], our methods produced insulin at the highest levels yet achieved from an expandable, human stem-cell-derived tissue.
However, a more detailed analysis of how parameters of economic development are associated with health outcomes as well as NCD risk factors is needed to inform local and global health policies.
CVD risk factor surveillance should be incorporated into national program planning and into best practices for NCD control supported by the World Health Organization and other health development agencies.
Rather, we need to learn from the history of socioeconomic development that it is not simply affluence that permits the increased impact of CVD and other NCDs; it is the risk factors for these diseases that spread across socioeconomic boundaries, causing the same illnesses regardless of the socioeconomic status of the population.
Addressing CVD risk factors could best be accomplished through improved international cooperation, better understanding of the risks of globalization, and development of appropriate research and technologies that apply to low- and middle-income populations.
These trends have forced many countries to change their treatment policies and use more expensive drugs, including drug combinations that will hopefully slow the development of resistance.
Kim and colleagues took human neural progenitor cells derived from brain, and exposed them to a series of signals that are known to drive pancreatic islet development.
Hyperlipidemia represents an important modifiable risk factor in the development and progression of CHD.
An adult without diabetes requires a minimum of 100 to 125 grams (400 to 500 calories) of glucose per day to prevent protein catabolism and the development of ketosis.
More importantly, the use of a sliding scale treatment might predispose to DKA in insulin-deficient patients before the development of hyperglycemic levels.
The development of early warning systems (EWSs) for epidemics of infectious diseases based on recurrent statistical patterns in other kinds of information, particularly data on climate, is an active area of research [1,2].
Furthermore, our system also offers a novel platform to study basic mechanisms of mesodermal induction and differentiation during early human development.
One of us (JTM) has previously reported the development of a novel microchip-based detection system for measuring analytes such as acids, bases, electrolytes, and proteins in solution phase [21â€“23].
Further development of the ETC system has shown that it could be adapted to the detection of bacteria, spores, and living cells [24].
In addition, both the bias in the method described here (âˆ’50 cells) and the accuracy at higher CD4 counts are likely to be improved significantly by the further development of a disposable microfluidic cartridge, where the volume of distribution of the sample will be much smaller, and more accurate volumetric control will be possible.
While the methods we described provide the basis for a highly portable and flexible miniaturized CD4 counting system, it should be emphasized that a number of additional developments are required to enable the widespread use of this approach in resource-limited settings.
Such a device is currently in commercial development, and may be available by early 2006.
We believe that the future of low-cost diagnostics for use in the developing world lies in the development of new lab-on-a-chip technologies that integrate sample preparation and sample measurement systems into miniaturized devices with minimal power requirements.
Use of vaccinia vectors in humans is problematic, especially in areas where HIV infection is common—immune-suppressed individuals can develop serious skin lesions—and several alternative vaccines based on other vectors as well as harmless vaccinia ones are under development.
As cells specialize during development they pass through different levels of differentiation, from the earliest stem cells through to the highly specialized types that make up the body's organs.
Further development of protocols will be needed to address this issue.
In addition, the techniques described here will provide a very useful resource for studying mesenchymal cell development.
I was especially struck by the many stories recounting the development of a particular patient's illness, the patient's efforts to manage it, and the resulting interactions with health professionals.
If we are to restore objectivity to drug development, prescribing, and safety monitoring, we must be willing to examine and change all of the institutions that allow this synchrony to occur.
There are also a number of new academic consortia with novel strategies to address issues of target discovery and preclinical development.
With funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, more than a dozen faculty and scientists from six research institutions (see Box 1) are working in collaboration with Immtech International to manage the “cross-over” development of antifungals produced by Immtech as potential drugs for African trypanosomiasis, also known as African sleeping sickness.
This approach takes advantage of drug development of a class of compounds targeting a viable commercial market for Immtech (fungal diseases of the developed world).
Strategy three: An academic center uses a philanthropic gift to woo expertise from industry and build infrastructure for preclinical drug development.
Here, philanthropic support was used to build infrastructure for a consortium of laboratories that mimics what might be found in a small- to medium-sized pharmaceutical company organized to carry out preclinical drug discovery and development.
Validation of this compound as an antiparasitic was carried out by the UCSF team through rodent models of disease and, next, supported, as in the case of the Tulane consortium, by Dr. Chuck Litterst, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Drug Development and Surveillance Group.
The UCSF group initially handed over further development of a drug candidate to the Institute for OneWorld Health (iOWH), one of the nonprofit organizations that has sprung up to meet “downstream” drug development needs for neglected diseases (see Sidebar).
The UCSF group initially handed over further development of a drug candidate to the Institute for OneWorld Health (iOWH), one of the nonprofit organizations that has sprung up to meet “downstream” drug development needs for neglected diseases (see Sidebar).
The Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (www.dndi.org) has now become the main partner for further development [4].
The Sandler Center consortium itself is now focusing on completing preclinical development of similar drug candidates targeting homologous enzymes in several other major global pathogens.
The future is likely to see a number of academic or academic–industrial collaborations supporting preclinical development in consortia like those described above.
This prediction was already borne out at the April 2005 meeting, “Drug Development for Diseases of Protozoa,” sponsored by the Keystone Symposia.
In the short time since the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene meeting, it has become clear that more academic laboratories are encouraged to pursue drug discovery and development avenues beyond research traditionally thought of as academic.
In addition, significant help from some large pharmaceutical companies, notably the Trés Cantos laboratory of GlaxoSmithKline, has fueled focused academic- and nonprofit-organization drug development efforts.
For example, DISC1 modulates neurite outgrowth, there is an extensive literature on the involvement of NRG1 in the development of the CNS, and RGS4 may modulate intracellular signaling for many G-protein-coupled receptors.
In this essay, we characterize the current HIV epidemic in Nepal, look at the ways in which the conflict may be fuelling the infection rate, and discuss the current local and international response from the health and development community.
Foreign aid, which accounts for nearly 60% of Nepal's development budget, may have paradoxically contributed to lopsided development in Nepal.
Foreign aid, which accounts for nearly 60% of Nepal's development budget, may have paradoxically contributed to lopsided development in Nepal.

One important development in recent years has been within the area of condom promotion for HIV/AIDS prevention.
HIV/AIDS is no longer only a health issue, it is also a development issue.
There is also some evidence that combinations of therapies could greatly retard development of resistance to the partner drug.
Current antiviral therapies include lamivudine and alpha-interferon, but long-term resolution of the disease is disappointing because of low seroconversion rates and the development of drug-resistant viral mutants.
However, they suggest that these results indicate that although drug development of antivirals is an established research avenue, targeting the host is an untapped opportunity.
The detection system used in the present report is a tabletop instrument that serves as a prototype for a fully portable handheld model, which is now under development.

(a) The provision for the reduction of the stillbirth-rate and of infant mortality and for the healthy development of the child;
The development of a vaccine or other preventive biomedical intervention therefore bears the greatest hope to curb the rampant HIV epidemic [2].
The belief that experiments involving realistically low challenge doses require unfeasibly large numbers of animals has prevented the development of low-dose challenge models.
This shift of focus required the development of novel statistical models that allowed the estimation of these indirect effects [42,43].
Will the estimation of vaccine efficacy in repeated low-dose challenge studies also require the development of novel statistical techniques?
If the probability of infection changes significantly with the number of challenges, however, the development of novel statistical models that take such changes into account will be necessary to adequately estimate vaccine efficacy.
Animal models can play an essential role in guiding preclinical vaccine development, including in studies of preclinical vaccine safety, vaccine toxicity, and vaccine immunogenicity.

Much of the new development has occurred here, and in some places this has changed the character of the landscape.
Its disadvantage, if it matters, is a lack of attractiveness: it is a rather soulless hodgepodge of development with no real character.
There is no development here for two main reasons.
The southern-most margins of the island — away from the pressure of human development — are a haven for wildlife.
This area, the farthest from Kingston, lagged behind other parts of Jamaica in modern development, protected from the commercial activity of the east by the limestone landscape of Cockpit Country, making travel and communication difficult.

We Americans profess to be so concerned with kids, and education, and early brain development, and on and on, and even today working moms are subject to tremendous amounts of disapproval for supposedly compromising their children's whatever, no matter how terrific their child-care arrangements are, but now we are taking the most vulnerable kids and saying we don't care what kind of arrangements you make, just show up for your sub-minimum-wage street-cleaning job, which will hardly ever lead to a real job, and which you have to drop out of school to get to.

For the most part, the book consists of a rewriting of history, from the dawn of time, with the purpose of demonstrating two main themes: the “fact” that women were responsible for all the important contributions to the advancement of civilization (as the development of agriculture, for instance), often despite the arrogance and stupidity of men; and the “fact” that women have long been subjected to domination by men.

Coulmas's clear exposition of the history of writing systems traces the development of various kinds of writing systems--ideographic, pictographic, morphemic, syllabic, phonemic, and phonetic--through history, discussing them individually, describing how certain ancient scripts were deciphered, and presenting his cogent arguments for regarding at least some aspects of language through the analysis of writing.
As the speakers of various languages applied it to their needs, it became somewhat more sophisticated; the Elamites, for example, were able to economize on the number of symbols by assigning to most of them syllabic identity, a major step toward the development of alphabetic writing.
The text is punctuated here and there by tables showing the progressive development of selected symbols (as, for example, in Sumerian), the Devanagari syllabary (in which several modern and ancient Indian languages are written), the Hebrew, Arabic, and other alphabets, Chinese and Japanese writing, and attractive drawings showing the hieroglyphic (with sound values in English orthography).
I strongly suspect the Germans, for instance, of having initiated--or at least aided and abetted--one of the most disturbing developments now under way in the English language: the disappearance of the verb may/might .

There can be no doubt whatever that with this development logical exposition could thereby become relentless.
It was discovered--and this should no longer be any cause for wonder--that a sentence containing however could also begin with but . Moreover, but could appear directly in front of nevertheless . But this development reached its zenith with the use of but as a topper conjunction (see the beginning of this sentence); the topper but does not in reality indicate a contradiction, for it always appears at the start of a sentence which is, truth be, in harmony with preceding sentences, but rather it tops the previous statements by pointing unerringly to that which is promised by contradiction, namely illumination.

The language of extraterrestrials merits only passing mention in Lunatic Lovers of Language, which deals with the development of artificial languages and with the search for language universals, characteristics that many (or all) languages share and that lend credence to the notion that there was only one original language from which the present stock has liverged.

The first edition of Baugh's History was published in 1935; because so much has happened to English since then, it is fitting that its history be updated, not only to reflect more recent developments in dialect, lexicon, grammatical theory, and the universal adoption of the language as a lingua franca, but also to revise scholarship in the light of later research that either elaborates or confutes information that is now more than half a century old.
As the result of observation over a period of many years of driving through or past suburban residential developments within a half hour of my home, I have induced principles of street taxonomy, by sheer inference, that demonstrate that streets in such places are designated by:
Of course these principles do not account for all the streets in a particular development and do not necessarily apply in all developments, but I cannot be responsible for a developer's ignorance of my findings or for his aberrant conduct in disregarding them.

It was his work that formed the basis of the linguistic studies later carried on by the brothers Grimm (Jakob Ludwig Karl, 1785-1863; Wilhelm Karl, 1786-1859), which, in turn, gave foundation to the development of the comparative method.
I am prejudiced, I know, but while I find the use of impact as a verb an interesting linguistic development, I consider it execrable style for literate speakers and (especially) writers; yet it appears in Rose's Preface, where one can also find a transitive use for coruscate ( OED2e please note).

It is probably true to say that an entire book could be written about this recent period in dictionary development, including not only the reflection of sound linguistic philosophy but the effects of the introduction of computers into the dictionary research, compilation, composition, and accession (as through personal computers to CD-ROMS and diskettes): certainly there is more documented information about it than the period of several hundered years covered in the first fourteen chapters of Chasing the Sun .
It is probably the language that has borne much of the burden in that development: the first citation for acronym in the OED , 1943, quotes American Notes and Queries , which refers to earlier, unidentified usage of the term.
Nineteenth-Century English is an interesting if somewhat staid tracing of the development of English into a world language, though its influence today is probably owing directly more to events of the past sixty years than to the growth and spread it enjoyed during the century of colonialism.
So, we must find other friends who can help us see that this project reaches the only reasonable conclusion for a dictionary—the letter Z.

Marianne Stoller writes of the work of New Mexican women artists and why they have been left out of history.
Several New Mexican women who descended from the early Spanish settlers of the region wrote personal life histories that incorporated the traditional way of life of the Hispano community of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Because of its long history New Mexico will always be a bountiful reservoir for the serious folklorist.
It is more than an autobiography, since it is interspersed with folklore narratives, Hispano traditions, and early southwest history.
Tattoos of Christian images have always been popular among Chicanos, and the custom of tattooing images of Jesus Christ, crucifixes, La Virgen de Guadalupe, and other Madonnas has a long history.
His research and publications encompass various disciplines from anthropology to literature to social history.
Paredes’s research emphasized the importance of the informant’s culture, and the social setting and history of the community of the informant.
Because of its ancient history there are many variants of Los Pastores, and several versions have developed a comic dialogue between Lucifer and Cucharón, Bartolo, and the other characters.
Ramón Laval gives a brief literary history of de Urdemalas and publishes a small series of tales collected in Chile in the late nineteenth century.
Recent histories of Chicanos and the Catholic Church suggest that Mexicans were not dependent on a priest-centered religion and developed their own popular devotions performed without a priest.
With His Pistol in His Hand: A Border Ballad and Its Hero, published in 1958 by the University of Texas Press, is not only one of the most important academic works on the history of the Chicano, but it is also respected as major scholarship in the field of folklore studies, and specifically on the genre of the ballad.
It is a study of a border ballad, “El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,” which looks at the history of the Texas-Mexican border and the life of Gregorio Cortez, and presents an analysis of the man as a ballad hero.
It is the cultural monument that unites the French across history.
God somehow will redeem all of us at the end of history.
We had descended into the bloodiest war of our history without clear purposes or any understanding of how it might end.
Here we take a page from British constitutional history to understand how a practice can be become part of the accumulated historical constitution without this being the purpose of those who initiated the practice.
This generates a dynamic of history that should, according to the theory, eventually produce a revolution by the exploited class of laborers.
But, as we have learned from the history of alcohol and cigarette consumption, advertising and peer group influence can lead people to develop habits that they later regret.
With his carefully crafted two-minute speech at Gettysburg, the best political address in the nation’s history, Lincoln created a Nomos, a world of norms and meaning, for comprehending the mass slaughter on American soil.
Thus, by extending themselves out over history, Americans became a nation in the European sense, in the same sense as had already been realized in England and in France and was then making itself felt in the unification movements in Italy and Germany.
Each people of common history and language constitutes a nation, and the natural form for the nation’s survival was in a state structure.
My sense of the literature of American history is that our scholars not only ignore the biblical influences on Lincoln’s thinking at Gettysburg but also fail to understand the significance of the “nation” that “our fathers brought forth on this continent.”
If this was the thrust of mid-century European history, the same was to be expected of the immigrant nation of the United States.
The nation is born of history; the dead link us to time past.
The fantasies of power, the aspirations of “We the People” cannot undo the defining power of history.

Four score years of history proved that their self-ordering led them, as Lincoln put it in the second inaugural, into committing “offences” for which they would pay with a “terrible war.”
Before turning to the counter thrust of postbellum history, we need to understand more fully the internal coherence of the constitutional order signaled by the Gettysburg Address.
Given the long history of popular belief in the intrinsic superiority of certain classes of people—men, whites, Christians, Americans—the philosophical belief in equality stands as a critique of commonly held beliefs.
The postbellum history of the United States has carried the egalitarian message of Gettysburg into the liberation of ever more marginal groups.
Our sensibilities are conditioned by our history.
But, however difficult the struggle, we have a history of which we can be proud.
The limited political sphere of the nation facilitates the recognition of others as human beings sharing a common history.
They need not be brothers and not exactly friends, but they could at last recognize each other as compatriots with a common language, a single history, and a shared future.
By 1868, we had in place a clause in the Fourteenth Amendment that was unique in American constitutional history: no state could “deprive any person of the equal protection of the laws.”
33 As history would have it, however, the “privileges and immunities” clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has not had—at least until recently—any impact on constitutional debates.
Yet, there is reason to applaud Black’s reading of our history, as there is to honor the divergent views found in Bruce Ackerman’s and in Akhil Amar’s writings.
35 Amar, too, reads the history in his own way.
History never gave them the chance.
As American history took its course in the decades that followed the “war for the nation,” we managed to betray the inner meaning of the great sacrifice that Lincoln sought to consecrate at Gettysburg.
But the states that entered the Union between the founding of the nation and the end of the Civil War, all twenty-three of them, could hardly be thought of as enjoying the same history of a prior state of independence as the original thirteen.
How the Court accomplished these acts of reinterpretation constitutes a major chapter in the intellectual history of the United States.
It is the history of the way in which we took the words of the postbellum legal order, betrayed their inner sense, and assimilated the new legal order into the original Constitution of 1787.
In 1869, four years after the war was over, the Louisiana legislature passed a statute that brought home the persistence of a dispute about economic freedom that reached back to the earliest stages of modern European and English legal history.
The confrontation was so deep and so wrenching for the history of the Constitution that these conflicts have taken on epic proportions.
The “abstract justice” mentioned by the dissenting Justice Field derives from the weight of history.
Applying the traditional rule of jus soli to everyone born on American soil—except for the children of diplomats and other people “not subject to the jurisdiction” of the country—had the radical effect of eliminating family and racial history from the definition of the bond between citizen and government in the United States.
For the advocates of the butchers’ economic rights, the critical perspective was the long history of emancipating craftsmen and laborers from the feudal bondage that subjected them to a network of service and financial obligations.
This was the first time in our history that constitutional amendments carried with them an expansion of Congressional authority.
The nation comes alive, as Lincoln viewed our history, as a bond forged in an historical struggle.
Lincoln had conceived of rooting our history in the identity generated by the struggle for independence.
History had forged a unique nation of people of diverse origins.
55 The ideals of Gettysburg became, for the lawyers in the second half of the nineteenth century, a matter of history.
Our history took a different course, one that required us to confront, in ways that we hardly expected, the moral difficulties of understanding equality under law.
This transformation of a slave population was unique in the history of revolutionary wars.
We live in a time of national disintegration—witness Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and the near-misses in Canada—and, therefore, the state is properly advised to cultivate a common identity and a sense of shared history and destiny.
19 The proponents of patriotic rituals, such as honoring the flag, could learn from the history of religious sensibility in the United States.
The first is Feynman’s famous sum over all possible trajectories, or histories, approach.
The classical pathway, therefore, is simultaneously the most probable pathway over the sum of histories of all possible pathways, and the pathway that requires the least action.
If Feynman’s sum over histories must assume a smooth background space and time, then it cannot as such be taken as primitive in quantum gravity.
Second, granting a continuous background space and time, Feynman’s sum over all histories still only gives a maximum of the amplitude for the photon to travel the classical pathway, it never gives an actual photon arriving at the counting surface.
If some fail to arrive, the sum over all histories fails.
In essence, Hartle and Gell-Mann ask us to consider “the quantum state of the universe” and all possible quantum histories of the universe from its initial state.
Some of these histories of the universe may happen to decohere.
Hartle and Gell-Mann argue that the decoherent histories of the universe, where true probabilities can be assigned, rather than mere amplitudes, correspond to the classical realm.
It is striking that there appear to be two such separate accounts of the relation between the quantum and classical worlds, Feynman’s sum over histories in a smooth background space-time and decoherence.
This begins to suggest preferred histories of the universe concerning such comeasuring pairs of quantum systems.
If so, this begins to refine the suggestion of preferred histories of the universe concerning comeasuring pairs of quantum systems toward a preference for the emergence of classical diversity and complexity: If quantum systems with more coupled degrees of freedom irreversibly decohere more rapidly into classical behavior when they interact than smaller, simpler systems, then the kinetics of decoherence should persistently favor the irreversible accumulation of bigger, more complex quantum systems, rather than of smaller, simpler, quantum systems.
A history becomes a “world-line” in space-time.
I now describe one approach to thinking about quantum gravity and the emergence of a smooth large-scale geometry based on this mandala and on Feynman’s idea of a sum over all histories.
Begin with all amplitude concentrated in the initial spin network tetrahedron in gamma . In this vision, a unit of time elapsing is associated with a Pachner move, such as a move from gamma to a point in gamma . With analogy to Feynman’s sum over all possible histories, consider the set of all pathways that begin at the initial tetrahedron in gamma and end on a given specific spin network N time steps later, for N = . That final spin network might lie in the gamma- ring, the gamma- ring, the gamma- ring, or any ring out to the gamma-N ring.
If we consider the family of all histories beginning on gamma and ending in a specific spin network in the gamma N = ring, those pathways must be very similar and few in number.
Then (goes the hope shared with Smolin) the neighboring spin networks in the gamma-N shell constitute nearly the same geometry and nearly the same action in the sum of histories reaching them, which begins to suggest that a smooth large-scale geometry might emerge.
Second, Feynman’s sum over histories assumes a classical continuous space and time.
It may be entirely invalid to attempt to use a sum over histories argument in this quantum geometry setting.
Third, assuming we can use Feynman’s sum over histories, we still have possible quantum geometries, not an actual geometry.
Imagine a sum of histories from an initial gamma- tetrahedron in a mandala with some given fundamental amplitude laws (thereby the initial and boundary conditions are specified), where the pathways in that set of histories pass up and down the stack of mandalas such that the fundamental amplitude laws change, as does the spin network, and then consider the bundle of all such histories that end on a given spin network in a given gamma ring with given, perhaps new, fundamental amplitude laws.
Imagine a sum of histories from an initial gamma- tetrahedron in a mandala with some given fundamental amplitude laws (thereby the initial and boundary conditions are specified), where the pathways in that set of histories pass up and down the stack of mandalas such that the fundamental amplitude laws change, as does the spin network, and then consider the bundle of all such histories that end on a given spin network in a given gamma ring with given, perhaps new, fundamental amplitude laws.

In eect, this conceptual move allows there to be quantum uncertainty not only with respect to spin networks along histories, but also quantum uncertainty with respect to the law by which amplitude propagates.
Then one can imagine a sum over all histories that, by constructive interference alone, picks those pathways, hence fundamental amplitude laws, that minimize the change in the ways amplitudes propagate.
Then, by mere constructive interference, one can hope that such a process would pick out not only the history, but also tune the law to the well-chosen fundamental amplitudes laws that maximized constructive interference.
In such a large-scale classical-like space and time, Feynman’s familiar sum over histories that minimizes a least action along classical trajectories would emerge as a consequence.
Nevertheless, it is possible that the concept of the law selecting itself via maximum constructive interference in a sum over all possible histories in a space of both spin networks and laws might possibly have relevance to string theory.
I therefore make the suggestion that the same pattern of reasoning that I described above, a sum over histories of trajectories that vary both in configurations and in the laws, which maximizes constructive interference, might prove a useful approach.
In the hyperspace of Calabi-Yau spaces, where one Calabi-Yau space can deform into its neighbors, it should be possible to construct a sum over all histories of trajectories between an initial and final state in the same or dierent Calabi-Yau space, then seek such sums over histories that maximize constructive interference.

The first is based on Feynman’s sum over histories, but as a perturbative theory assumes a continuous background space-time and does not get rid of the linear superposition of possibilities that is the core of quantum mechanics and interference.
In place of the anthropic principle or Lee Smolin’s cosmic selection, I have suggested one possible approach to the choices of the constants of nature by maximizing constructive interference over a sum of all histories through a space of both configurations and laws.
A brief history of the origin of writing: In the early Near East, loans of sheep and goats were common.
If we cannot have all the categories that may be of relevance finitely prestated ahead of time, how else should we talk about the emergence in the biosphere or in our history = a piece of the biosphere = of new relevant categories, new functionalities, new ways of making a living?
And as we shall see in detail, the exaptations of Gertrude and others leaves macroscopic living footprints, propagating frozen accidents, on the history of the universe.
The specific molecular configurations that arise almost certainly include molecular species that are ever unique in the history of the universe.
In short, since the relevant timescale for the ergodic hypothesis to hold is vastly longer than the actual present history of the universe, the macroscopic features of the universe with respect to the specific sets of complex molecules that exist on this planet  in giant cold molecular clouds, and so forth  are kinetically trapped into an infinitesimal subset of those molecular species that might have come into existence in an ensemble of dierent histories of the universe.

History enters when the space of the possible that might have been explored is larger, or vastly larger, than what has actually occurred.
Precisely because the actual of the biosphere is so tiny compared to what might have occurred in the past . billion years and because autonomous agents can evolve by heritable variations that induce propagating frozen accidents in descendant lineages, the biosphere is profoundly contingent upon history.
The advantages of trade predate the human economy by essentially the entire history of life on this planet.
Indeed, we allow agents to evolve how much of the past history of the interactions they will pay attention to and how complex their models of one another will be  one, four, or fifty Fourier modes.
Agents evolve in a history and complexity space to find currently optimal amounts of history and complexity to use to optimally predict their neighbors.
Agents evolve in a history and complexity space to find currently optimal amounts of history and complexity to use to optimally predict their neighbors.
In our little world, the agents evolve to use a modest history, ignoring the distant past, and only modestly complex theories of one another.
Given the semantic import of yuck and yum, and the reality of natural games for fox and hare, for E. coli and paramecium, these changing theories and actions are part of the fabric of history of the market, the savannah, and the small pond.
The history of Western architecture is of architects searching for rules, only to bend and break them.
Although art historians use terms like Gothic Revival and Greek Revival to distinguish later reincarnations of styles, architects look at history differently.
Consciousness of the past may also explain why architects tend to resist being categorized according to style; they instinctively understand that the history of architecture—including the present—is a continuity rather than a series of episodes.
Although Renaissance architects described their architecture as all’antica—in the antique manner—they took it for granted that the history of architecture was a progression: the Romans improved on the Greeks, and they would improved on the Romans.
For the first time in history, all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the United States were grounded, stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the country.
If the government's leaders understood the gravity of the threat they faced and understood at the same time that their policies to eliminate it were not likely to succeed any time soon, then history's judgment will be harsh.
This pattern has occurred before in American history.
The catastrophic threat at this moment in history is more specific.
History has shown that even the most vigilant and expert agencies cannot always prevent determined, suicidal attackers from reaching a target.
Travel history, however, is still recorded in passports with entry-exit stamps called cachets, which al Qaeda has trained its operatives to forge and use to conceal their terrorist activities.
There are many databases just in the United States-for terrorist, criminal, and immigration history, as well as financial information, for instance.
Our history has shown us that insecurity threatens liberty.

The history, culture, and body of beliefs from which Bin Ladin has shaped and spread his message are largely unknown to many Americans.
His rhetoric selectively draws from multiple sources-Islam, history, and the region's political and economic malaise.
It does mean that some Muslims tend to be uncomfortable with distinctions between religion and state, though Muslim rulers throughout history have readily separated the two.
The extreme Islamist version of history blames the decline from Islam's golden age on the rulers and people who turned away from the true path of their religion, thereby leaving Islam vulnerable to encroaching foreign powers eager to steal their land, wealth, and even their souls.
Bin Ladin's Worldview Despite his claims to universal leadership, Bin Ladin offers an extreme view of Islamic history designed to appeal mainly to Arabs and Sunnis.
A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought.
Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history.
To the second question, what America could do, al Qaeda's answer was that America should abandon the Middle East, convert to Islam, and end the immorality and godlessness of its society and culture:"It is saddening to tell you that you are the worst civilization witnessed by the history of mankind."
History and Political Context Few fundamentalist movements in the Islamic world gained lasting political power.
Millions, pursuing secular as well as religious studies, were products of educational systems that generally devoted little if any attention to the rest of the world's thought, history, and culture.
If the instigation for jihad against the Jews and the Americans to liberate the holy places "is considered a crime,"he said,"let history be a witness that I am a criminal."
With this history, the CIA brought to the era of 9/11 many attributes of an elite organization, viewing itself as serving on the nation's front lines to engage America's enemies.
The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained.
Proposals to help the Northern Alliance had been debated in the U.S. government since 1999 and, as we mentioned in chapter 4, the U.S. government as a whole had been wary of endorsing them, largely because of the Northern Alliance's checkered history, its limited base of popular support in Afghanistan, and Pakistan's objections.

Risk factors included previous MI or stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram, history of type 2 diabetes, current cigarette smoking, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level.
The differences in eligibility risk factors between those participants with HF and those without is not surprising: larger percentages of those with HF had a history of MI, stroke, CABG, angioplasty, other atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), diabetes, low HDL levels and ECG abnormalities.
A recent example is [ 8 ] , in which all participants, even those who discontinued treatment (lovastatin or placebo), were contacted annually for vital status, cardiovascular events, and cancer history.
Herein, we will analyze the integrated function of the metabolic pathways, and there has been a long history of mathematical modeling of metabolic networks in cellular systems, which dates back to the 1960s [ 11, 12].
However, we have used the biochemical literature to refine the in silico metabolic genotype and given the long history of E. coli metabolic research [ 20], a large percentage of the E. coli metabolic capabilities have likely been identified.
On a practical level, using phylogeny to reconstruct viruses' mutational histories and then using intuited mutations leaves one with insufficient data to determine positively-selected codons [ 36] unless, as some have done, one assumes observed drift is neutral and then tests for codons where selection is more positive than average [ 23, 38].
Due to domain shuffling many proteins are mosaic proteins, composed of domains with different evolutionary histories [ 46 47 ] . For such proteins it makes much sense to analyze each domain individually.
The cDNA array has a long history of development [ 3 ] stemming from immunodiagnostic work in the 1980s; however, it has been most widely developed in recent years by Stanford University (California) researchers depositing cDNA tags onto glass slides, or chips, with precise robotic printers [ 4 ] . Labeled cDNA fragments are then hybridized to the tags on the chip, scanned, and differences in mRNA between samples identified and visualized using a variation of the red/green matrix originally introduced by Eisen and colleagues [ 5 ] . The light-generated oligonucleotide array, developed by Affymetrix, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA), involves synthesizing short 25-mer oligonucleotide probes directly onto a glass slide using photolithographic masks [ 6 7 ] . Sample processing includes the production of labeled cRNA, hybridization to a microarray, and quantification of the obtained signal after laser scanning.

These patterns have been interpreted as a general signature of the symbiotic origin of eukaryotes [ 2 3 ] and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of symbiont genes to the nucleus [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 ] . On the one hand, this complexity resulting from HGT can obscure some aspects of evolutionary history [ 8 ] . However, HGT also can provide the means to investigate otherwise difficult questions, such as inferring the number of symbiotic events and estimating the time of those events.
The purpose of this study was to examine the temporal relationship between the origin of eukaryotes and events in Earth history.
Until about five years ago, it was generally accepted that there was a prior period (before mitochondria) in the history of eukaryotes [ 2 26 ] . The basal position of eukaryotes lacking mitochondria (amitochondriate) in phylogenetic trees [ 27 ] was consistent with this supposition as was evidence from sequence signatures [ 6 ] . However, molecular phylogenetic studies of several proteins in recent years have suggested that some or all amitochondriate eukaryotes once possessed mitochondria in the past [ 9 ] . Based on this new evidence, most current models for the origin of eukaryotes assume only a single symbiotic or fusion event between an archaebacterium and an α-proteobacterium [ 8 28 29 ] .
Moreover, the timing of these biological events is consistent with the timing of events in geologic and atmospheric history (Fig.
The possibility even has been discussed that the amount of lateral gene exchange is such that it invalidates the very principle of representing the evolution of species as a tree; instead, the only adequate representation of evolutionary history could be a complex network [ 6 ] [ 25 ] . Genome-trees seem to be the last resort for the species tree concept.
It appears that this is the only meaningful way to treat the notion of a species tree: as the history of a relatively large ensemble of genes, not a comprehensive representation of the history of entire genomes.

Life history theory and experiments have repeatedly demonstrated trade-offs between current survival and future reproduction in both animals and plants [ 16 17 ] . According to this theory there is an overall energy budget for an organism, with a finite amount available to divide between these two evolutionarily important processes.
, [ 23 24 ] ]. The middle repetitive fraction was viewed as the descendent of once active TEs that had the misfortune of inserting into transcriptionally inert heterochromatin at some point in their evolutionary history [e.g.
We compare this phylogeny to one derived from 16S rRNA, and suggest possible implications for the evolutionary history of arsenic resistance in microorganisms.
These results add to our understanding of the natural history of glaucoma in mice and provide a new animal model for studying glaucoma involving increased IOP.
Although none of the patients had a family history of DMD, all were determined to be highly likely to have dystrophin gene mutations, as opposed to other genetic causes of muscular dystrophy (see Table 1).
Through the advertisement in the campus newspaper of this institution, healthy subjects without a prior history of diabetes and hypertension were invited to participate in the study.
A causal association between squamous cell carcinoma arising in the head and neck region (HNSCC) and exposure to tobacco and alcohol is well established [ 1 2 3 ] . However, 10-15% HNSCC occur in patients without any antecedent history of tobacco or alcohol exposure [ 4 5 ] . Several studies have suggested that these patients have a divergent clinical course compared to patients with tobacco associated HNSCC, which may be a reflection of differences in the genetic composition [ 4 5 6 ] . Empiric evidence suggesting that non-smokers may respond differently to carcinogenic insults is offered in a report by Schantz et al.
The study population was divided into 15 (21%) patients with limited and 56 patients (79%) with a significant tobacco/alcohol exposure history.
Of the 15 patients in low-level tobacco/alcohol exposure group, 13 patients gave no history of tobacco usage, while 10 patients gave no history of alcohol exposure.
Of the 15 patients in low-level tobacco/alcohol exposure group, 13 patients gave no history of tobacco usage, while 10 patients gave no history of alcohol exposure.
Of the two patients with tobacco exposure histories, one gave a history of smoking less than 2 packs of cigarettes in her lifetime and the other had a history of smoking 0.5 pack years, 51 years prior to presentation with cancer.
Of the two patients with tobacco exposure histories, one gave a history of smoking less than 2 packs of cigarettes in her lifetime and the other had a history of smoking 0.5 pack years, 51 years prior to presentation with cancer.
Of the two patients with tobacco exposure histories, one gave a history of smoking less than 2 packs of cigarettes in her lifetime and the other had a history of smoking 0.5 pack years, 51 years prior to presentation with cancer.
Tobacco usage was coded as a dichotomous variable, and was considered positive if a greater than 2-pack year smoking history was reported.
For the purpose of this study, patients were divided into two groups based on the history of carcinogen exposure.
Group 1 had a limited or no history of tobacco and/or alcohol exposure, while group 2 patients reported significant tobacco and/or alcohol exposure.
Analysis of these numerous segments can provide important indications of the evolutionary history of a particular region, or gene.
Although other genomic and functional studies would be required to prove an orthologous relationship between NPM3 and NO29, they appear by several analyses to share a relatively close evolutionary history and as such could be considered candidate orthologs.
Phyletic patterns, evolutionary history and potential biological functions of the CYTH domains
Different parts of genomes have different histories, and representing the history of genome evolution as a single tree appears inconsistent with the data.
Different parts of genomes have different histories, and representing the history of genome evolution as a single tree appears inconsistent with the data.
For studies of single divergent orthologous protein encoding genes the assumption of a tree-like evolutionary history remains a reasonable expectation.
Rather prokaryotic genomes are mosaics where different parts have different evolutionary histories.
However, no sequence or secondary structural similarities have been noticed between different SSAPs and current understanding of their evolutionary history and phyletic range remains poor.
In this study, we examined the evolutionary history of the TOX HMG domain.
This mosquito HMG-box is approximately 90% identical to that found in the mammalian TOX subfamily, despite the considerable evolutionary history separating the two.
The history of the T locus began with the discovery in 1927 of a semi-dominant mutation in mice, named Brachyury , or T for tail, that affects both embryonic viability in homozygotes and tail development in heterozygotes [ 1 ] . This original T allele represents a deletion spanning 160-200 kb (reviewed in [ 2 ] ), the developmental effects of which have been well characterized [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 ] . Homozygous mutant embryos show a developmental failure of the notochord and posterior mesoderm, and die at midgestation.
Evolutionary history, domain architectures, and gene neighborhoods of the HNOB and HNOBA domain proteins
They arise late in a culture's history apparently from filaments shed from large mature structures.
It should be stressed, however, that little is known about the histories (i.e.
Subjects with a history of psychopathology and/or taking medication were excluded.
Tissue was rejected if harvesting did not occur within 7 hours postmortem and 48 hours of storage on ice, or if the donor had a history of eye disease.
Although no major differences were noted in cognitive functioning amongst HIV-infected asymptomatics with or without a history of drug abuse [ 6], a subsequent study showed that a history of injection drug use and presentation with prominent psychomotor slowing was associated with more rapid neurologic progression [ 7].

Changes in sleep drive are thus driven by the sleep-wake history.
Non-REM sleep (NREMS) intensity, quantified as EEG power in the delta frequency range (1-4 Hz), and NREMS consolidation are in a quantitative and predictive relationship with sleep history: both variables increase with the duration of prior wakefulness and subsequently decline during NREMS [ 3 4 10 12 13 ] . These variables are thus quantitative markers of NREMS homeostasis and are presumed to reflect an underlying physiological drive for sleep [ 4 ] .
In wild type mice, EEG delta power still varied as a function of the sleep-wake history with high values at the end of the baseline dark period and after the SD and low values at the end of the light or major rest period (Figure 1).
We tested the assumption of a relationship between delta power and the sleep-wake history by using a mathematical method that predicts the level of EEG delta power occurring in individual NREMS bouts based on the 42 h sequence of 10-sec behavioral state scores for individual animals [ 10 ] . With this analytical tool, the time constants of the increasing delta power during wakefulness and its decrease during NREMS are estimated.
For both genotypes, delta power in both baseline and recovery from SD could be reliably predicted on the basis of sleep-wake history (Figure 1), which is underscored by the highly significant correlations between empirical and simulated data (r = 0.91 and 0.87 for cry1,2 +/+and cry1,2 -/-, respectively, P < 0.0001 for both genotypes).
Thus, in the absence of cryptochromes , NREMS delta power varied as a function of the prior sleep-wake history.
The increase in per expression after the sleep deprivation was specific to the cerebral cortex, although it cannot be ruled out, based on the present study, that circadian gene expression changes with sleep-wake history in specific nuclei within the other two regions examined; i.e., the hypothalamus and basal forebrain.
Thus, in both nocturnal and diurnal species, per expression in the cortex is maximal in conjunction with the major waking episode [ 37 49 50 ] . Under conditions where the phase (methamphetamine administration, restricted feeding) or distribution (circadian splitting) of locomotor activity is altered, per expression in the cortex parallels the overt rhythm of wakefulness, whereas the circadian oscillation of per gene expression in the SCN remains unaffected [ 49 51 52 ] . Thus, in contrast to its role in the SCN, PER protein in the cortex is not a component of a self-sustaining circadian oscillator [ 53 ] . Instead, per expression in the cortex seems to the follow sleep-wake history, consistent with the hypothesis that it is related to homeostatic regulation of sleep.
In clinical practice, NSAIDs are associated with acute renal failure in patients with impaired renal function [ 41 42 ] and with congestive heart failure in older people with a prior history of heart disease [ 43 ] . Acute renal failure after surgery occurs in 1 patient in 1000 after major surgery [ 44 ] , though it is not clear how much of this is specifically due to the NSAID.
See also [ 16 ] for a justification of this behavior of z(t) based on modeling natural history in breast cancer screening.
Case-control studies require adequate case identification, eligibility criteria for equal access of cases and controls to screening, distinguishing symptomatic and diagnostic tests, and adjustments for self-selection bias [ 1 ] . Cohort studies often involve natural history models which rest upon assumptions about the duration of preclinical cancer or the growth rate of the tumor, the sensitivity of the screening test, and how screening affects cancer mortality.
Some examples can be found in [ 2 3 4 5 6 ] . Importantly natural history models based only on observational data must implicitly assume no selection bias, a very tenuous assumption.
In contrast, periodic screening evaluation (PSE), which combines estimates from screened subjects to estimate the reduction in population cancer mortality associated with periodic cancer screening [ 7 8 9 ] , does not involve natural history models and the associated assumptions.
In certain situations these assumptions may be more plausible than the natural history assumptions, so in some circumstances, the method may be complementary and possibly superior, to the natural history modeling approach.

Suppose that instead of (1), the probability of missingness depends on treatment assignment, baseline strata, and an unobserved binary covariate x . For our example from the Polyp Prevention Trial, x could be an unreported indicator of a family history of colon cancer.
They completed a questionnaire on risk factors for atherosclerosis including family history of coronopathy, smoking, high blood pressure, personal history of coronopathy or myocardial infarct, history of cerebrovascular disease or occlusive peripheral disease.

As stated in the introduction obesity in childhood is associated with obesity in adulthood [ 22 23 24 25 ] , and is a predictor of all cause of obesity-associated mortality during adulthood, particularly mortality from cardiovascular diseases, which is independent of adult weight [ 24 25 ] . The results of the present study agreed with a previous study [ 50 ] indicating that the metabolic alterations caused by excess body fat are expressed early in the natural history of obesity.
Controls in Olmsted County were drawn from a longitudinal Mayo Clinic study on the natural history of lower urinary tract symptoms.
Continuing education for physicians about the natural history and treatment of hepatitis C is of key importance in helping them to provide optimal advice to their patients.
The patient reported a prior history of infectious mononucleosis at age 18 and was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol infrequently.
There was no family history of allergy to sulfa products.
Although Still's disease can rarely lead to hepatic involvement with cholestatic hepatitis, the prior history of rheumatoid factor seropositivity and a low serum ferritin level made this diagnosis unlikely [ 21 ] . Granulomatous hepatitis with marked elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase and granulomas on liver biopsy have been reported in patients with SSZ hepatotoxicity [ 22 23 24 ] . Although liver tissue was not obtained in our patient, the predominance of serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin level elevations and the presence of granulomas in other tissues suggest that she probably had granulomatous hepatitis.
As compared to the negative controls (group B- 11% and group C- 14%), crypt apoptosis was frequent in A-GVHD- 91% with statistically significant difference (Table 2K 2 ). With proper clinical history, the diagnosis of A-GVHD can be suggested if apoptosis is observed in and around the crypts.
The studies identified were carefully evaluated for eligibility; they were included if they (i) enrolled subjects with thalassemia major - irrespective of age at diagnosis, treatment initiation or study start nor of treatment history in terms of transfusion regimen or iron chelation; (ii) followed patients treated with either desferrioxamine administered subcutaneously or intravenously or oral deferiprone; and (iii) measured hepatic iron concentrations to evaluate treatment efficacy.
Since the sensitivity of the rapid tests remains high on treated patients therefore, it will be important to take patients history into consideration during routine usage of the rapid tests.

[ 26 27 28 29 30 ] In addition to diabetes mellitus, a number of VVC risk factors have been identified, including African-American heritage [ 15 16 17 ] , previous history of VVC [ 15 ] , higher education degree, intermediate age, oral contraceptive pills [ 3 10 16 18 ] , use of commercially available solutions for cleansing of external genitalia or vaginal douching, frequent sexual intercourse [ 17 19 10 ] , sexual behavior (age at first intercourse, frequency of oral-genital contact) [ 20 ] , contraception devices (diaphragm, vaginal contraceptive sponge, intrauterine device), and antibiotics [ 3 15 19 ] . Whether these factors increase risk of Candida colonization or symptomatic infection following colonization, or both, is unknown, however, it should be emphasized that a prerequisite for symptomatic vaginitis is vaginal colonization.
The questionnaire addressed the following variables: sociodemographic (age, race, marital status, insurance status, highest education completed, occupation); diabetes duration, type, severity, and abnormal glucose level; lifetime history of physician diagnosed VVC episodes; recent antibiotic use, by type; sexual history; health behaviors.
The questionnaire addressed the following variables: sociodemographic (age, race, marital status, insurance status, highest education completed, occupation); diabetes duration, type, severity, and abnormal glucose level; lifetime history of physician diagnosed VVC episodes; recent antibiotic use, by type; sexual history; health behaviors.
Antibiotic use in the past 2 weeks, lifetime history of chlamydia, douching, and report of both performing and receiving oral sex in the last two weeks were strongly associated with Candida colonization, whereas vaginal-penile sex had only a modest and not statistically significant assocation with Candida colonization.
When added individually to the base model, lifetime history of chlamydia (OR = 5.8; 95% CI: 10.
Douching and history of chlamydia were also strongly associated with performing oral sex; adding each of these variables reduced the parameter estimate and statistical significance of the association with performing oral sex.
Pregnancy history had no association with colonization after adjustment (OR = 0.97; 95% CI:0.
Among women with diabetes, Candida carriage increased with older age, type 1 diabetes, abnormal HbA 1c level, oral antibiotic use in the previous two weeks, and ever history of chlamydia.
Other VVC risk factors, including African American descent, lifetime history of VVC, higher education, oral contraceptive use, and frequency of vaginal intercourse were not significantly associated with Candida colonization after adjustment for other variables.
The association we observed with chlamydia is probably a marker of sexual behavior rather than a causal factor; for example, women who reported a history of chlamydia were more likely to douche and to report engaging in oral sex, although it is possible that chlamydia carriage adversely affects the vaginal flora increasing the chance of Candida colonization.
Although it is possible that women with a history of symptomatic infection might have been more likely to participate, we have no reason to believe that women differentially participated by both symptomatic history and other variables under study which would have biased our results.
Although it is possible that women with a history of symptomatic infection might have been more likely to participate, we have no reason to believe that women differentially participated by both symptomatic history and other variables under study which would have biased our results.
We found strong, statistically significant associations between vaginal Candida colonization and antibiotic use, lifetime history of chlamydia, diabetes type and HbA 1c level and a borderline significant association with performing oral sex.
Recent studies of high-risk urban women from several cities in the United States suggest HIV incidence rates in the range of 0.018 to more than 7 new infections per 100 person-years [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 ] , with the highest rates observed among women who reported exchanging sex for money or drugs and women with a recent history of acquiring other STDs such as syphilis.
In the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, mass campaigns were conducted to treat schistosomiasis infections in these areas, during which individuals older than 5 years of age were treated with tartar emetic injections [ 15 ] . Sero-surveys conducted in the 1990's in Egypt have reported positive associations between HCV infections and a history of schistosomiasis or a history of having received injections for the treatment of schistosomiasis [ 9 12 13 16 ] . Based on this evidence, the studies suggest that inadequately sterilized needles and syringes used during the campaign were probable causes for transmission of HCV in the region.

We postulate that an entire household was more likely to have participated in the campaign if at least one member of the household had a history of schistosomiasis and received treatment by injections, compared to houses in which no member reported a past history and parenteral treatment for schistosomiasis.
We postulate that an entire household was more likely to have participated in the campaign if at least one member of the household had a history of schistosomiasis and received treatment by injections, compared to houses in which no member reported a past history and parenteral treatment for schistosomiasis.
History of schistosomiasis was obtained by interview in which participants were asked whether they had ever received a diagnosis of schistosomiasis.
Regardless of their histories, all participants were further queried about past treatment for schistosomiasis and whether the treatment was with oral drugs, injections or both.
To estimate the degree of clustering of HCV infections, a history of parenteral treatment of schistosomiasis in the house was considered to be a blocking factor.
Houses in which an adult member reported receiving parenteral treatment were more likely to have other adult members with histories of parenteral treatment for schistosomiasis.
Among the 746 individuals who reported no history of schistosomiasis or no parenteral treatment for diagnosed schistosomiasis, the prevalence of HCV was 38% compared to 68% for the 50 individuals who reported receiving the treatment (p < .0001).
In contrast, the OR for clustering of HCV infections among houses in which no member reported a history of parenteral treatment for a past schistosomiasis infection was 1.37 (95% CI: 0.92 - 2.05; p = 0.12).
Most previous studies that have that have found associations between histories of schistosomiasis and HCV have either been designed as surveys or have used ecologic associations.
During the 6-week period prior to the start of the study, candidates were screened for study eligibility, demography, CDC classification, HIV risk factors, mode of HIV transmission, antiretroviral therapy history, and medical history, and given a physical examination.
During the 6-week period prior to the start of the study, candidates were screened for study eligibility, demography, CDC classification, HIV risk factors, mode of HIV transmission, antiretroviral therapy history, and medical history, and given a physical examination.
Several factors that the rule does not take into account may greatly influence the decision to admit a patient, the most important being factors related to the patient such as poor social support, inability to maintain oral intake and history of substance abuse.
Clinical histories

Although the parents of Case 1 were not available for study, the negative family history suggests that this deletion is also
Individuals with no history of nephropathy and no albumin excretion were considered free of nephropathy.
Family history and twins studies support the existence of genetic susceptibility to stroke [ 1 2 3 4 ] . Mendelian disorders known to be associated with an increased risk of stroke include hemoglobinopathies, dyslipoproteinemias, and cardioembolic disorders [ 5 ] . Most known Mendelian stroke disorders present in infancy, childhood, or young adulthood and collectively represent only a small proportion of all stroke cases.
Probands are adult men and women who 1) have a diagnosis of at least 1 ischemic stroke confirmed by the study neurologist, 2) report having at least 1 living full sibling with a history of stroke, and 3) have attained their 18th birthday at the time of enrollment in the study.
Virtually all delayed cerebral ischemia occurs 5 to 21 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage [ 55 56 ] . 3) The index stroke is presumed due to an autoimmune condition - that is, the patient has a history of brain-biopsy-proven central nervous system vasculitis.
3) The subject reports having no medical history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and denies ever having had symptoms of stroke.
The local coordinator or study neurologist conducts a face-to-face interview with patients who meet enrollment criteria to obtain their medical history and to explain the study.
The Clinical Coordinating Center contacts potentially discordant siblings who provide contact information, obtains verbal consent for a brief telephone interview, administers the QVSFS (Table 1), and obtains a standardized medical history in a structured telephone interview.
Siblings who give negative answers to the QVSFS medical history items but who give a positive response to 1 or more of the review-of-symptoms items are advised to inform their primary care physician of their symptoms so that they can be evaluated accordingly.
Although as many as 10% of the concordant siblings in SWISS may have a history of 2 or more strokes, the SVC confirms the diagnosis and classifies the subtype of ischemic stroke only for the most recent stroke for which there are records sufficient to confirm the diagnosis (the sibling index stroke).
Data are collected on stroke risk factors and medical history, date of onset of stroke symptoms, TOAST stroke subtype, and the total number of living full siblings.
The following information is collected on all living full siblings who return sibling response letters: name, date of birth, gender, name of the proband they are related to, twin status, home address, home phone number, e-mail address, alternative contact information, and standardized risk factor and medical history.
An alternative design to one using affected relative pairs is that of genome-wide association in subjects with ischemic stroke (cases) ascertained without respect to family history compared with nonstroke controls for frequency of numerous, densely spaced genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs).
Association studies in a case/control framework have a long history in stroke etiology research.
Population-based studies of SAH probands show that 7 to 10% have a family history of IA, a higher percentage than previously appreciated [ 1 19 20 ] . These familial IA (FIA) families have no signs of any other simple Mendelian disorders predisposing to IA, supporting the possibility that some or all IAs have a genetic component, and that FIA is a genetic disease separate and apart from previously defined diseases.
Eighty-five families with at least two members with ruptured or unruptured IA and no family history of polycystic kidney disease were ascertained from a sampling frame of 1150 consecutive patients treated between 1977 and 1990 for aneurysmal SAH by the Department of Neurosurgery at the University Hospital of Kuopio, which serves a genetically homogenous population of 870,000 in eastern Finland [ 1 ] . Initially, family history was assessed by a short questionnaire and all putative cases were confirmed from medical and autopsy records.

Her immediate family history was significant for symptomatic bradycardia requiring pacemaker implantation.
A 45 year-old Caucasian woman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy, and fatigue was seen in the University of Chicago's Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic for evaluation and treatment.
Because of her marked fatigue and family history of sudden death, a dual chamber pacemaker and automatic defibrillator were implanted.
Individuals with DCM and conduction system disease should be screened by family history and genetic testing.
Only the primary discharge diagnosis was used to ensure these were active diagnoses, ie, to exclude diagnoses with "history of poisonings."
[ 1 ] Atrial fibrillation is worthy of separate study from other dysrythmias due to unique aspects of its natural history and management.
As shown, there were marked disparities by age, blood pressure, dialysis modality, and history of left ventricular hypertrophy.
To assess for possible confounding, logistic regression was also performed to assess for significant associations with a history of HIVAN using the same covariates as for Cox Regression as above.
All patients enrolled in these trials were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease according to NINCDS-ADRDA classification [ 15 ] . The patients had a mild-to-moderate disease (MMSE scores 10-24) with a history of cognitive decline, gradual onset, and progressive disease over a period of at least six months.
Each patient with suspected stroke admitted to a participating center is evaluated by a study neurologist according to current standards for care [ 17 18 ] . The evaluation includes patient history, physical examination, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of the head, and laboratory testing.
Adult men and women who meet the following criteria are entered into the study: 1) diagnosis of first-ever ischemic stroke confirmed by the study neurologist on the basis of history, physical examination, and head imaging by CT or MR; 2) enrollment within 30 days after onset of stroke symptoms; 3) attained 18th birthday by the time of enrollment; 4) complete blood cell count, casual or fasting blood glucose, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time available; and 5) written informed consent from the patient or surrogate.
We confirm that controls have not had a prior stroke by means of the Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-free Status (QVSS), a structured interview that was validated in an adult population (age, > 60 years) using systematic review of electronic medical records as the benchmark [ 25 ] . The QVSS was further validated in an independent population using history and physical examination by a study neurologist as the benchmark [ 26 ] . Interviewers administering the QVSS may exclude a subject they judge to be an unreliable historian on the basis of a global impression of moderate or severe impairment of speech, language, hearing, or memory.
Hospitalized patients being treated for coronary or peripheral vascular disease are not eligible for enrollment as controls, but nonhospitalized subjects with a history of these conditions are eligible.
A proband-derived family history is taken for all living or deceased full siblings, all biological children, and both biological parents [ 28 ] . Investigators do not independently verify stroke status of family members as part of this protocol.
Self-reported cerebrovascular histories are obtained for all patients and control subjects by administering the QVSS during the baseline interview [ 25 ] .
The following information is recorded on the case report forms: patient history, physical examination, CT or MR of the head, white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin concentration, casual or fasting blood glucose, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, vital signs (height, weight, blood pressure, and temperature), international normalized ratio, lipid profile, plasma homocysteine concentration, and size and location of the symptomatic cerebral infarct as seen on head imaging.
However, if acquired deficits of speech, language, or cognition prevent the patient from participating in the telephone outcomes assessment, a surrogate history is taken from a caregiver or live-in relative.
Coordinators will also record mortality and history of cause of death from collateral sources.
Additionally, we have given careful attention to appropriate selection of controls [ 27 ] . The controls are concurrently enrolled at the same centers as are the patients, and controls are also screened for a medical history of stroke or transient ischemic attack and for the presence of symptoms of stroke or transient ischemic attack which may have occurred in the absence of a corresponding medical history.

Cohorts who reported at baseline a history of hip fracture were excluded from the hip fracture analysis (30 women and 27 men) for a total sample size of 5989, and those who reported a prior malignant tumor or growth were excluded from the cancer analyses (120 women and 49 men) for total sample sizes of 5877 for the colorectal cancer analysis, 3108 women for the breast and uterine cancer analyses, and 2769 men for the prostate cancer analysis.
However, the effect was found to be far greater in women with a positive family history of breast cancer in the Framingham report.
Among those without a family history of breast cancer, the risk was not significantly increased [ 18 ] .
Unlike Framingham, family history of breast cancer did not alter the results related to BMD.
During the linking process, a list of health plan members who had at least two cancer diagnostic codes in their claims history were matched against the HTR using a probabilistic method.
We then excluded 265 cases diagnosed after June 30, 1998 because we would not have a complete history of claims data covering at least six months of treatment.
Our study had several limitations, including the possibility of incomplete claims histories if patients changed health plans during the course of treatment, but the high agreement with HTR information indicates that the validity of insurance claims information was high.
The 16-page instrument covers information on tobacco and alcohol consumption, family history of cancer, occupational and environmental exposures, reproductive and medical histories, and diet.
The 16-page instrument covers information on tobacco and alcohol consumption, family history of cancer, occupational and environmental exposures, reproductive and medical histories, and diet.
Variables that were evaluated but not included in the multivariate model were occupational asbestos exposure, dietary fruit and vegetable intake, and family history of lung cancer.
The M6P/IGF2R informative patients and those not used in this study were insignificantly different from each other for the clinical characteristics of gender, age, race, smoking history, baseline hemoglobin, Karnofsky performance status, tumor resectability, treatment, tumor stage, nodal stage, overall staging and site of primary tumor (Table 1).
Due to the manner in which we receive our specimens, the nature and medical history of the donors' diabetes are unknown.
Lenses with obvious nuclear scattering, history of cataract, or cortical or posterior subcapsular scattering were excluded from the study.
All donated lenses had no history of laser or intraocular surgery, and were obtained according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Further investigations employing a broad population of samples with extensive medical histories will yield additional, more conclusive results about the relationship of diabetes and nuclear cataract.
She was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy to healthy, unrelated parents of Northern European descent with a negative family history.
Reye syndrome, a disorder of unknown cause, is characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty degeneration of the liver and it is usually characterized by a history of preceding viral illness or the use of aspirin during viral infections [ 10 ] . Many children with metabolic disorders present with Reye-like syndrome episodes, usually at a young age and/or with a positive past or family history suspicious for an inborn error of metabolism [ 11 ] . It has been reported as a presenting sign of type I 3-MGC aciduria and in a few cases of mitochondrial cytopathies in older children [ 12 13 ] . However in the neonatal period, a Reye-like episode is not a typical presenting feature of a mitochondrial cytopathy.

However in the neonatal period, a Reye-like episode is not a typical presenting feature of a mitochondrial cytopathy.
Since no primary deleterious mtDNA mutation has been found in the proband and she was born to healthy parents with unremarkable family history, we hypothesize that the etiology of her mitochondrial dysfunction could reside in a still unidentified nuclear gene defect; although secondary mitochondrial dysfunction caused by an unknown inborn error of metabolism cannot be excluded completely.
Family history was significant for Hashimoto's thyroiditis in the mother, maternal aunt, and maternal grandfather.
Occasional patients may come to attention in late childhood or adulthood but careful history often indicates that symptoms have appeared earlier [ 18 19 ] . The mainstay of treatment is dietary restriction of sucrose-containing foods.
Menarcheal History
In children, the rate of occurrence has customarily been given as 3 to 5%, but recent studies show the condition is present in 15% or more of school age populations [ 11 12 ] . Persistence of ADHD into adulthood has been shown to occur in 30 to 50% (or more) of childhood cases [ 13 ] , depending on the criteria used [ 14 ] . It is clear that adults with a history of ADHD in childhood have greater difficulty functioning compared to their non-ADHD peers [ 15 ] . One example is the higher rate of substance use disorders in ADHD adults compared to the general population [ 16 ] , such use often viewed as a kind of "self-medication" of unpleasant emotions [ 16 ] . In obesity, similar patterns of eating (seeking immediate gratification, using food to reduce dysphoria) have been observed [ 17 ] , though not previously linked to ADHD.
Structure was in accord with DSM-IV criteria, that is, a patient needed to have shown, or given substantial history of 6 or more inattentive behaviors to be considered as having ADHD.
Most research has focused on hormonal changes, previous history of psychiatric disorders, and social milieu as main risk factors for postpartum depression.
Four mothers reported a previous history of crying spells, not going out, or "depressed mood" after the birth of a previous but not the current child.
More investigation is needed in the area of light exposure or light therapy in those women who are concurrently experiencing depressive symptoms or have a history of psychiatric illness.
Although we limited our characterization of the population to age and sex, it is also possible to use more detailed information about disease history, for instance to characterize the burden of illness among individuals with specific chronic diseases.
, previous medical history, demographics, sources of biosolids, and environmental conditions).
In the first case, an 11-year-old male in Osceola Mills, PA with an unremarkable medical history died of staphylococcal septicaemia.
Medical records were available for three of the four infected residents: Patients 1, 3, 8. Patient 1, a 17 year-old male with a history of excellent health, was treated for a furuncle of the knee in February1993 then succumbed to S. aureus pneumonia in March 1995 after contracting a rotavirus infection and viral pneumonia.
The 16-page instrument covers information on reproductive and medical histories, family history of cancer, occupational and environmental exposures, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and diet.

They consisted of known and suspected risk factors for pancreatic cancer: age, education, cigarette smoking, family history of pancreatic cancer, race, sex and body mass index.
As packyears of cigarettes smoked smoking (packs per day × years of smoking) and family history of pancreatic cancer were found to be predictors of disease in our data, they were adjusted for in the regression models, along with age.
Descriptive characteristics of pancreatic cancer cases and hospital controls are shown in Table 1. Cases were more likely to be smokers, have a family history of pancreatic cancer, less likely to have schooling beyond high school, and have a higher BMI.
In general, the risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals obtained following adjustment for smoking and family history of pancreatic cancer were very similar to the unadjusted, crude results.
Despite these limitations, it should be pointed out that numerous previous studies that have utilized the PEDS database, and faced the same methodological issue, have consistently replicated established epidemiological associations for a variety of cancer sites [ 31 32 33 34 35 ] . Further, as mentioned above, smoking and family history of pancreatic cancer are two of the few established risk factors for pancreatic cancer [ 36 ] , and they were found to be associated with disease risk in our data.
Four were conducted with childbearing aged women with a history of substance abuse (hereafter referred to as drug-dependent women focus groups).
Further, they can (and should) guide and measure the impact of interventions [ 1 ] . Public health surveillance - a subset of HIS - has been defined as the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of outcome-specific data for use in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice [ 2 ] . Public health surveillance can be used to 1) assess the overall health status of a population, 2) describe the natural history of disease, 3) monitor disease trends, 4) detect epidemics, 5) evaluate the effect of prevention and control measures, 6) generate hypotheses, and 7) facilitate epidemiologic and laboratory research [ 3 ] .
On the evidence from a case series published in 1992 by the manufacturer, Hoffmann-La Roche, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that travellers with a personal or family history of seizures or manic-depressive illness should not take mefloquine prophylaxis.
The multicentre cohort study of prophylactic mefloquine use should be questionnaire-based, and should enquire specifically into the major risk factors (alcohol intake during travel, hydration status, use of hormonal contraception and recreational drugs, other potentially hepatotoxic or thyrotoxic drugs, previous history of proven or suspected liver and/or thyroid abnormality) that we have proposed.
Should mefloquine be prescribed to people with a personal or family history of neuropsychiatric illness?
We believe that people with a history of any proven or suspected liver or thyroid abnormality in the previous two years should avoid mefloquine.
[ 78 ] We believe that this exclusion is unjustified, as long as there is no recent history of liver or thyroid disease, and provided the precautions we have proposed above (avoidance of alcohol, maintenance of hydration and non-use of hormonal contraception, recreational drugs and certain co-medications) are adhered to.
Lobel et al consider that WHO's exclusion of people with a personal or family history of neuropsychiatric illness from taking mefloquine is based 'on limited evidence or theoretical concerns', and we believe their scepticism is justified.
Since we have no information on the likelihood of diagnosis given travel history in the clinical setting in the Bay Area we were unable to evaluate whether this was indeed the case.
Studies are required that stratify subjects on the basis of their travel history prior to analyzing other cryptosporidiosis exposures so that it is possible to distinguish between the specific travel and non-travel associated risk factors.
In addition, we excluded eligible controls who had a history of psychiatric illness or psychosis.
The questionnaire (see Additional File 2) consisted of 17 multiple-choice questions, mostly about respondents' attitudes and projected behavior regarding smallpox and smallpox vaccination, knowledge and topics of concern, and self-assessed health history relative to smallpox vaccination (previous vaccination, contraindications).
Self-assessed health history relative to smallpox vaccination
Forty-five percent of those who completed the question on contraindications said either "yes" (37%) or "don't know" (8%) to at least one of the contraindications in our list of 8. The most common (self-reported) contraindication was household member with current or past history of eczema or atopic dermatitis - 16% of respondents reported this situation.
The next most frequent contraindication was current or past history of eczema or atopic dermatitis in oneself, reported by 13%.
Some important data, such as smoking history and the use of chemoprophylaxis and antiretroviral drugs, were not collected.
The following exclusion criteria applied to the current analysis: race other than Caucasian or African-American (n = 33), missing information on diet (n = 111), missing information on height, weight, smoking status, laboratory values or education (n = 177), missing pulmonary function tests (n = 250), unacceptable or not reproducible pulmonary function tests (n = 108), a history of COPD, asthma or pulmonary fibrosis (n = 249) or missing information on alcohol intake (n = 54).
Between 6:30 and 9:30 am we obtained spirometric measurements from participants, standardized according to 1994 American Thoracic Society guidelines [ 30 ] . To derive forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) prediction equations we used multiple linear regression with values obtained from lifelong nonsmokers who did not report a history of chronic lung disease for men (n = 277) and women (n = 418) separately.
We used the Cognitive Lifetime Drinking History (CLDH) to obtain information on lifetime alcohol intake [ 31 32 33 ] . Prior to the interview, participants completed a lifetime events calendar on which they recorded the date and their age when significant events in their lives occurred.
In a study involving 147 subjects [ 32 ] , we compared the average daily volume of alcohol consumed during the 12-24 months prior to the interview as estimated from the alcohol questionnaire with those estimated from two different food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), the Health Habits and History Questionnaire and the Harvard Semiquantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire.
However, we obtained a lifetime drinking alcohol history using an instrument with good test-retest reliability [ 33 ] , an approach that has not previously been used.
CLDH, Cognitive lifetime drinking history
At baseline and monthly follow-up visits, patients had a full medical history and physical examination, a complete blood count (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, Florida, USA), sputum AFB microscopy and culture, chest radiography, and serum β 2 -microglobulin measurement (β 2 -microglobulin enzyme immunoassay (EIA); Coulter, Miami, Florida, USA).
Both groups had similar tuberculosis and HIV-infection-associated symptoms though the subjects with an unfavorable outcome were more likely to have presented with a past history of fever, diarrhea, and thrush.
Subjects have been followed approximately every two years with health history questionnaires, physical examinations, and blood testing.
Multivariable analysis was performed using linear regression, adjusting for age (quartiles: ≤ 40, 41-47, 47-53 and 54+), gender (male or female), race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/other), smoking history (nonsmokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers) and weight (study population quartiles, ≤ 66 kg, 67-78 kg, 79-88.
Multivariable analysis, adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking history and weight, was performed using linear regression.
Further studies of the immunologic characteristics of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from HTLV-I or -II infected humans are needed, especially in persons with a history of recurrent pneumonia or acute bronchitis but without myelopathy or uveitis.
Demographic and operative information including relevant past medical history and the type of thromboembolic prophylaxis utilized was collected for the experimental and control groups as summarized in Table 1. Approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at our hospital prior to initiating this study and all patients signed informed consent prior to participating in the study.
A significant difference was noted however in that the patients in the experimental group had a significantly higher percentage of patients with a personal or family history of thromboembolism (p < 0.001 for both).
It was noted however, that a significantly greater percentage of patients who suffered a thromboembolic event had a personal or family history of thromboembolism (p = 0.001 for both).
Although residual abnormalities of the deep venous system could account for the higher prevalence of a personal history of prior deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, the higher prevalence of a family history of thromboembolic events suggests that an as yet undescribed genetically determined hypercoagulable state or predisposition may be present in these patients.

Cases were eligible if they were ≥ 30 years of age, had a histo-pathologically confirmed, non-metastatic SCC of the skin diagnosed within the past 4 months, with no prior history of a skin cancer.
One control per household was invited to participate using modified Waksberg criteria [ 30 ] . Control subjects were considered eligible if they had no prior history of skin cancer, lived within the Tucson region, and were within the age, gender, and ethnicity grouping.
This interview instrument sought information on: skin characteristics, sunburns and tanning history, use of suntan lotions and sunscreens, residential history, UV exposure during past year, family history of skin cancer, past medical history, tobacco and alcohol use, physical characteristics, and demographic information.

Age, sex, inability to tan after prolonged sun exposure, number of current freckles on the arms, and history of diagnosed and treated actinic keratosis (AK) were included in the final multivariate model.
Participants in the current study did report more AK history than subjects who did not participate in the study, with the increase being consistent for cases and controls.
Table 1shows the distribution of cases and controls according to sex, age, smoking status, alcohol intake, reported tanning ability, history of AK, number of current freckles on the arms, and daily hours of sun exposure during the past year.
Only tanning ability, history of AK, number of current freckles on the arms, citrus peel use and hot black tea consumption showed a significant difference between cases and controls.

This study controlled for important confounding factors, including history of physician-diagnosed actinic keratosis, tanning ability, and number of current freckles on the arms.
The displacement protocol began with at least 3 displacement stretches of 2,000 μm to provide a constant stretch history in the muscle.
The velocity protocol again began with a series of 3 displacement stretches to 2,000 μm to provide a constant stretch history.
Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of RDRPs and DDRPs in an attempt to unveil the origin of the RDRP.
This view of the evolutionary history of RDRPs is compatible with the presence of RDRP homologs in phages and with their role in replicating microRNAs (potential relics of the RNA world) during PTGS in eukaryotes.
This scenario shows parallels to the probable evolutionary history of another major, unrelated class of polymerases, the RDRPs and reverse transcriptases containing the palm domain.
2) Patients met with all Management Team members for an in-depth interview and review of their medical, hearing, tinnitus, and psychosocial histories and conditions.
The patient with a 23 year history of diabetes also had a history of alcoholism.
The patient with a 23 year history of diabetes also had a history of alcoholism.
None of the subjects had a history of receiving cancer therapy, a possible confounding factor in the analysis of DNA damage.
[ 8 ] Only one report of diabetic ketoacidosis associated with tacrolimus use in a patient without a prior history of diabetes has so far been reported.
Rates of diabetic ketoacidosis by history of diabetes at the time of listing are shown in Table 1. Characteristics of the study population, as well as risk factors for diabetic ketoacidosis for the entire cohort and for recipients without a history of diabetes at the time of listing are shown in Table 2. As previously reported, the use of tacrolimus rose steadily during the study period, accounting for 5.2% of all calcineurin inhibitor use in 1994, 5.9% in 1995, 12.

2/1000 person years in recipients a history of diabetes as a comorbid condition and 1.9/1000 person years in patients without a prior history of diabetes (measured as total hospitalizations for comparison with other reports).
This approach to assessment may be quite distinct from familiar history taking and physical examination techniques.
Five women had a family history of premature ovarian failure (two patients had sisters with premature ovarian failure, one patient's mother had premature ovarian failure, one had a paternal aunt with premature ovarian failure, and one patient had a paternal aunt, a grandmother, and a great-grandmother who were thought to have the condition).
All patients underwent a history and physical examination and laboratory screening to confirm the diagnosis of premature ovarian failure.
All patients had a normal karyotype and had no history of chemotherapy or radiation.
The natural course of fibromyalgia shows that symptoms are generally the same over at least 7 years [ 3 ] . A stable, sharp reduction in symptoms in seven months, as we have reported here, is a definite alteration of the natural history of fibromyalgia.
Health care professionals have utilized spinal palpatory diagnostic procedures and manual manipulative treatment for several millennia to treat back injury and pain [ 7 8 ] . Along with the history of illness and physical exam, examiners utilize specific spinal palpatory diagnostic tests in order to identify spinal neuro-musculoskeletal dysfunction.
Besides hormone replacement, also excluded from the study were patients with a history of malignancy, endometriosis, and pelvic infections.
They did not have any demonstrable pelvic relaxation by examination or history of stress urinary incontinence.
This permits an evaluation of a history of exposure that is not possible with specimens such as saliva or urine.
A three-centimeter length of hair corresponds, on average, to approximately 90 days of past time or "history".
Students first learn skills by practicing on each other and by taking histories and performing physical examinations on selected patients.
OSCE committee members designated each question or task in the 16 stations as one of 7 clinical skills, defined as follows: asking appropriate questions for the history (history-taking); performing the physical examination correctly (physical examination technique); understanding the pathophysiology of physical findings (physical examination knowledge); identifying abnormalities on physical examination (identification of abnormalities); developing appropriate differential diagnoses for the clinical information obtained (differential diagnosis); utilizing appropriate patient-doctor interaction techniques (patient interaction); and orally presenting the history and differential diagnosis after taking a clinical history (patient presentation).

, 61 ± 4%) and interviewing skills (69 ± 11%), and lower on problem solving (50 ± 6%) skills [ 33 ] . In a non-OS CE examination using patient management problems, second-year students scored 70 ± 9% on history, 66 ± 10% on physical examination, and 40 ± 15% on diagnosis [ 34 ] . However, in an OSCE for a second-year neurology skills course, this pattern did not hold: interpretative skill scores (76 ± 16%) were higher than technical performance scores (67 ± 17%), but no significance testing was reported [ 15 ] .
Lower performance in knowledge of the pathophysiology related to physical diagnosis, compared with technical performance of the physical examination, suggests that improvements integrating pathophysiology into the teaching of the history and physical examination are needed.
A second search combined medical subject headings (MeSH) "Signs and Symptoms", "Physical Examination", and "Medical History Taking", linked by OR terms, with a text word search for "cirrhosis", through an AND term.
In some cases, the entire history and examination was performed together.
Accuracy of history and physical examination
Few studies described their clinical methods, where several exist for eliciting a finding [ 58 59 60 ] . These are deficiencies that should be carefully addressed in designing future studies that evaluate aspects of clinical practice, such as the history or physical examination.
The role and diagnostic accuracy of items from the clinical history were not examined.
It is likely that some of the study clinicians were aware of indicants from the clinical history.
The history of MIAME (minimum information about a microarray experiment) and MGED (microarray gene expression databases) Standards has been described [ 2 3 4 ] . XML was chosen as the formatting language for the effort to standardize gene expression data.
This means that there will need to be a standards committee that can make changes in the standard over time and that can keep a documented history of modifications in the standard.
4. A core section with data elements that describe each of the cores in the TMA block (what case did the core come from, what block from the case was used to make the core, what drill-site in the block was used, what was the diagnosis of the drill-site, what clinical history is associated with the core, what demographic information is associated with the patient from whom the core was taken, etc.).
[ 2 ] Fortunately, there are a number of interventions that can reduce the risk of CHD events in patients with no previous history of CHD, including smoking cessation counseling, hypertension treatment, aspirin prophylaxis, and treatment of lipid disorders.
Patients with a previous history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at high risk and generally warrant aggressive treatment; patients with no previous CVD history have a wide range of underlying CHD risk and hence require individualized decisions for optimal care.

The hypothetical patients were explicitly assumed: 1) to not be taking aspirin or lipid-lowering agents at baseline; 2) to not have responded to a trial of a low-fat diet; 3), to not be overweight; and 4) to not have a family history of early myocardial infarction.
Ten patients lived alone, and 19 patients had a past history of psychiatric disorder.
Only five patients had a history of alcohol abuse, as indicated by self-report and chart review.
We assessed history of substance abuse and psychiatric illness, by both obtaining information from the patient themselves and by reviewing patient charts.
Due to the limited number of patients with a history of substance abuse, we excluded substance abuse from the analysis.
Thus, we conducted a multiple regression analysis that included 7 predictor variables: age, years of education, living arrangement, ethnicity, psychiatric history, and performance at admission on the MMSE and the GDS.
SV-40 large T-antigen transfected human ovarian surface epithelial cell lines, MCC5 and HIO3261-77, were derived from women with and without a family history of breast/ovarian cancer, respectively [ 31 ] . While MCC5 cells were derived from a patient denoted as wild type BRCA1 status, HIO3261-77 cells were derived from a patient characterized as 185delAG mutated [ 39 ] . Dr. W. Bai (USF) kindly provided the MCF7 breast cancer carcinoma line.
Kisumu and Malindi are very different cities, differing across ecology, culture, history and economics.
All the controls were subjects without any clinical symptoms, signs or any suspicion of cardiovascular disease in their medical history, as a physician evaluated it.
After taking into account the effect of the aforementioned associations (descriptive analysis) as well as the effect of several potential confounders, like age and sex of the participants, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, total serum cholesterol and blood glucose levels, as well as premature family history of coronary heart disease, we found that effect of the consumption of Mediterranean diet on the coronary risk remains beneficial.
Color fundus photographs have been routinely employed for diagnostic purposes for many years, and fundus photo gradings are central to clinical studies of macular disease [ 1 2 ] . The natural history of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the developed world [ 3 ] , is in particular tied to that of subretinal deposits known as drusen [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ] . Drusen are key in the classification of AMD, hence the importance of drusen identification and measurement in clinical studies.
The following study covariates or known determinants of fetal growth (34) were abstracted from hospital delivery records and operationalized in a manner most consistent with most hospital records: maternal and infant race (white/nonwhite), parity (left continuous), uterine bleeding during pregnancy (yes/no), history of previous spontaneous abortion (yes/no), cigarette smoking during pregnancy (yes/no; if yes, average number daily cigarettes smoked during pregnancy), evidence placental infarction (yes/no), infant sex (male/female), gestational age (left continuous), placental infarction (yes/no), and birth defect (yes/no).
However, no other significant differences with respect to reproductive history were observed across categories of maternal fish consumption (data not shown).
The self-reported history of weekly physical activity is also a limitation.
All subjects reported no history of disease or other confounding factors.
Within 14 days before randomization, patients had a complete medical history taken and a complete physical examination.
We hypothesized that because of a history of sedentarity, pain and/or a high prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidi-ties, patients diagnosed as having clinical and radiographic hip OA would tend to be overweight or obese, rather than underweight or of normal weight.
Patients with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Lyme disease, septic arthritis and traumatic arthritis were excluded.
As Table 1shows, those who had comorbidities, including cardiac disease, hypertension, and diabetes, were heavier than those with no comorbid disease history.
One of the removed pros-theses was a replacement following a previous removal postinfection in 1999, in a 54-year-old white man with a BMI of 40 and a history of diabetes and atrial fibrillation.
At ages 30-39 years, an age range not implicitly associated with the presence of degenerative disease of the hip, 34 patients had evidence of a prior comorbid disease history.
The smoking histories were also validated using hospital medical records, by comparing the questionnaire response with the information from the standard clinical history and physical examination.
The smoking histories were also validated using hospital medical records, by comparing the questionnaire response with the information from the standard clinical history and physical examination.
Women who reported a history of breast cancer or augmentation surgery were excluded from the study.
In a linear regression model, we observed a weak association between calorie adjusted soy intake and percent densities (partial regression coefficient b = 0.009, P = 0.004) after adjustment for age, BMI, parity, and family history of breast cancer.
Because of the lack of a lifetime history of soy intake in our study, we do not know whether soy consumption during early life when breast development occurred was similar to the current intake.
Women who did not speak English, women who reported a history of breast cancer or augmentation surgery, and women with suspicious lesions on the mammograms were excluded from the study, but women taking oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy were eligible to participate.
Whereas we did not observe a relation between soy intake and the size of the dense areas, we found an association between calorie adjusted soy intake and percent densities ( b = 0.009, P = 0.004) after adjustment for age, BMI, parity, and family history of breast cancer.
The lack of a lifetime history of soy intake and the cross-sectional design limit our study's ability to establish causal relations.
Initial analyses [ 22] suggested that women with germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene and a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer have 85 and 44% lifetime risks of developing breast and ovarian cancer, respectively.
Recent studies [ 23], however, have suggested that analyses based on women who were not selected for a familial history of cancer indicate that the risk for cancer associated with mutations in these genes is 50 and 16% for breast and ovarian cancers, respectively.
It has been estimated that only 45-55% of breast cancer cases in the United States are explained by established risk factors such as income, reproductive factors, and family history [ 7 ] . Distinctive breast cancer incidence and mortality patterns in well-defined populations may therefore inform etiologic understanding.
In a large, national, interview-based study conducted in the 1970s, adjustment for reproductive patterns, menopausal characteristics, hormone use, alcohol consumption, body mass index, height, and family history did not entirely account for the relations of income and education to breast cancer risk [ 24 ] . To achieve a more contemporary understanding of the contributions of established breast cancer risk factors, it would be helpful to reassess the roles of factors whose prevalence has increased substantially over time, including delayed childbearing [ 25 ] and use of hormone replacement therapy [ 26 ] . In addition, there are ongoing efforts in Marin County to identify novel risk factors relevant to this socioeconomic group.
All consecutive cases of breast cancer, regardless of previous history, seen at presentation and later confirmed histologically in the Departments of Surgery and Radiotherapy of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria, from March 1998 to August 2000 were recruited at their first clinic presentation, after obtaining informed consent.
Obstetric and gynecological history such as age of onset of menarche, menstrual cycle history, whether periods had usually been regular, age at onset of menopause (natural or otherwise) and history of previous breast disease, as well as smoking, drug and alcohol use history, were obtained from the subjects.

In contrast, the Iowa Women's Health Study showed no association with WHR, and an earlier report of interaction with family history appeared to have attenuated with time [ 25 26 ] . In the New York University Women's Health Study, the multivariable analysis showed an association between the lowest quintile and the highest quintile of WHR and breast cancer of 1.72 (95% confidence interval = 1.0-3.
Interview data included medical, reproductive, dietary, and lifestyle histories.
Data on hormone replacement use were only available for women who were postmenopausal, and few women beyond menopause had a history of oral contraceptive use, so only premenopausal women were included for those analyses.
The odds ratios were adjusted for age, education, age at menarche, age at first pregnancy, reported family history of breast cancer, body mass index, history of benign breast disease, and age at menopause for postmenopausal women.
The odds ratios were adjusted for age, education, age at menarche, age at first pregnancy, reported family history of breast cancer, body mass index, history of benign breast disease, and age at menopause for postmenopausal women.
Included cases had a later age at menarche, were more likely to be premenopausal, and were more likely to report a family history of breast cancer than cases excluded from the analysis (data not shown).
Risk factors that were updated included menopausal status, family history, diagnosis of benign breast disease, and postmenopausal hormone use.
Relative risks (RR) were calculated by comparing the highest and lowest quintiles of nutrient intake (Q 5 versus Q 1 ). Multivariate models included age at diagnosis, family history of breast cancer in mother or sister, diagnosis of benign breast disease (BBD), age at menarche (in quintiles), body mass index at age 18 (in deciles), adult height (in quartiles), reproductive history (categorical), and vitamin A intake (continuous) in 1980 [ 15 ] . Current vitamin A intake was included in the model because we have previously shown in this cohort of women that lower intake of vitamin A is positively associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.

Current vitamin A intake was included in the model because we have previously shown in this cohort of women that lower intake of vitamin A is positively associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
Reproductive history was represented by dummy variables, indicating whether the subject had children, and, if so, the number of children (one, two, or more than two children) and the age at which the first child was born (before age 24, between ages 25 and 29 inclusive, or age 30 or older).
Breast cancer cases had later age at first birth, lower parity, increased adult height, and higher incidence of BBD, and were more likely than controls to have a family history of breast cancer.
A third limitation of the current study is the possibility of recall bias because high school diet history was obtained after diagnosis of breast cancer.
Questionnaire items pertinent to this report included detailed residential and school histories before age 21 years (such as location, ownership or rental, and dates in and out), highest level of schooling; total time of residence in Marin and other parts of the San Francisco Bay Area throughout the lifetime; ethnicity; childhood religion; parents' highest level of education and occupational characteristics at subject's age 5, 12, and 18 years; other measures of family's socioeconomic conditions including self-assessed socioeconomic status currently and before age 21 years; ages at menarche and menopause, and menopausal status; alcohol use and tobacco use and exposures; reproductive and breastfeeding history; family history of breast cancer; type and ages of use of female hormones; previous non-breast cancers; breast and cervical cancer screening practices; breast procedures; radiation treatments before breast cancer; and body weight and height at various times in life not including the times that the woman was pregnant or nursing or during the first 6 months after pregnancy.

In addition, ORs for residential history variables were adjusted for other variables included in the multivariate model, but not for each other, because the various residential variables were not mutually exclusive.
Personal and family health history
As shown in Table 2, there were no substantial or statistically significant differences in the frequencies of cases and controls reporting a first-degree relative with breast cancer or a history of benign breast biopsy.
Cases were more likely than controls to have had a history of uterine or ovarian cancer (OR = 3.0; 95% CI, 0.60-15.
Residence history
Interestingly, cases and controls were strikingly similar for several factors known to influence breast cancer risk (such as family history of breast cancer, contemporary socioeconomic status, age at first birth, or use of hormone replacement therapy).
For instance, although the overall rate of positive first-degree family history (19%) among cases is similar to that reported in other recent series [ 16 17 ] , the controls in this population had rates of family history comparable to those of the cases.

Cigarette smoking has not been consistently associated with breast cancer risk [ 12 ] . The elevated OR observed in this study for the highest quartile of pack-years smoked might be due to differential participation by controls with a lower pack-year history or differential reporting of smoking history by cases and controls.
Cigarette smoking has not been consistently associated with breast cancer risk [ 12 ] . The elevated OR observed in this study for the highest quartile of pack-years smoked might be due to differential participation by controls with a lower pack-year history or differential reporting of smoking history by cases and controls.
It is also possible that smoking history was confounded by factors not measured in this study, such as physical activity.
This was despite a higher proportion of controls with established breast cancer risk factors such as family history and nulliparity than observed in control subject groups in other recent studies.
Patients aged more than 75 years, those with inflammatory breast cancer, those with a previous history of contralateral breast cancer with higher stage of disease, and those with second primary other than basal cell carcinoma of skin or in situ carcinoma of cervix were excluded from the original MDACC 86-12 study.
Therefore, as in the study by Silber and colleagues [ 1 ] , this validation sample describes the natural history of neutropenia.
Patients who had history of severe dementia or had abused psychoactive drugs and alcohol were excluded from our study.
It has been determined that preoperative risk factors for delirium were older age [ 24, 25, 26], prior cognitive impairment [ 24, 25], pre-existing cerebrovascular or other brain diseases, history of prior delirium [ 25], preoperative abnormal sodium [ 24], vision or hearing impairment [ 24, 26] and regular use of psychotropic drugs before admission [ 24].
The patient with hypoglycemic-induced delirium virtually always has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
One common confounding variable of past studies has been the inclusion of children with a history of recurrent wheezing.
Preterm infants and infants with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, previous history of wheezing, or those needing admission to the pediatric intensive care unit were excluded from the study.
To estimate the sample size, we analyzed pulmonary function studies of 14 infants with a recent history of wheezing illness that were performed in our pulmonary function laboratory.
A family history of wheezing or atopy was present in nine infants.
Admission criteria to the study were as follows: stable preoperative haemodynamic conditions, no intravenous cardiovascular therapy, no preoperative diuretic therapy, sinus rhythm, no history of anaphylactic reactions, and normal hepatic and renal function.
In a number of newly admitted patients the diagnosis of sepsis becomes clear after taking the medical history and completing the physical examination [ 3].
One patient with a low SVR classified as idiopathic had a history of significant alcohol consumption.
Our drug screen should have identified tricyclic antidepressants or narcotics in the urine; however, a careful drug history was not elicited in this patient.
The admitting diagnoses are summarized in Table 1. Eighteen patients had a history of cardiac disease, 10 werejaundiced in the preoperative period, 10 underwent preoperative biliaryinstrumentation, nine underwent preoperative biliary drainage, five had ahistory of cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension, four had a history of chronicobstructive pulmonary disease, and three had a history of viral hepatitis.
The admitting diagnoses are summarized in Table 1. Eighteen patients had a history of cardiac disease, 10 werejaundiced in the preoperative period, 10 underwent preoperative biliaryinstrumentation, nine underwent preoperative biliary drainage, five had ahistory of cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension, four had a history of chronicobstructive pulmonary disease, and three had a history of viral hepatitis.
A history of viral hepatitis( P = 0.044) was determined to be significantly associated withpostoperative mortality among patients admitted to the SCU by univariateanalysis.
By univariate analysis, the association of history ofcirrhosis/portal hypertension with postoperative mortality was determined toapproach statistical significance ( P = 0.053) among patients admitted tothe SCU.
Multivariate analysis of those two variables revealed that neither ahistory of viral hepatitis and a history of cirrhosis/portal hypertension wasan independent predictor of postoperative mortality among patients admitted tothe SCU.
On univariate analysis, we found an association of a history of viral hepatitis with postoperative mortality ( P = 0.044) and a near association of a history of cirrhosis (with or without portal hypertension) with postoperative mortality ( P = 0.053).
On univariate analysis, we found an association of a history of viral hepatitis with postoperative mortality ( P = 0.044) and a near association of a history of cirrhosis (with or without portal hypertension) with postoperative mortality ( P = 0.053).
Therefore, preoperative prothrombin time and preoperative albumin, as well as a history of viral hepatitis and/or a history of cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension, may be taken to indicate a need for heightened alertness to the possibility of the need for critical care services after significant hepatobiliary surgery.

Malaria parasites have been with us throughout human history.
That study and natural history samples suggest that a sample size of 50-100 should be sufficient to demonstrate a neuro-protective effect on lesion volume in patients.
The determination of MI may require more clinical judgment in patients with inconsistent clinical history, cardiac enzyme data, and ECG information, or suspect cardiac enzyme data.
Furthermore, methods based on a different principle, such as protein sequence-structure threading, have a recent history of success despite uncertainties in their statistical foundations [ 22, 53, 54, 55, 56].
This observation, together with the phyletic distribution of these proteins, provides some clues to their evolutionary history.
One important point is that these regressions are ahistorical: by predicting a relationship between gene and protein composition, these studies imply that the history of a gene or species is unimportant compared to its current state.
Such ahistorical relationships are particularly useful in cases where the goal is prediction of the current state of a sequence (for example, for making PCR primers), rather than reconstruction of its history.
Interestingly, the history of a sequence seems relatively important in determining its codon and amino-acid usage.
This enabled us to infer the most likely history of the cluster duplications (Figure 6d).
Two irregularities in Figure 6dare interesting from the standpoint of genomic history of duplicated genes.
In addition, the history of the 2p cluster is somewhat obscure, as the 2p EGF gene is closest to the EGF gene at 4q27, whereas the 2p SLC4A gene is closest to the SLC4A at 4q13 (as no SLC4A gene is currently known to exist at 4q27).
With the exception of these irregularities, the duplication history in Figure 6dis very well supported by the gene family trees in Figure 6a-cand the full PHYLIP trees (data not shown).
Not only should it be possible to sketch out the history of the development of different biochemical machineries, it should also be possible to establish which parts of the proteins are most critical to function on the basis of amino-acid sequence conservation correlated with the structural contexts.
We have chosen to deal with proteins as modular entities where a module is defined as a protein element that has at least 100 amino-acid residues, carries a biological function and is presumed to have an independent evolutionary history [ 21].
The E. coli proteins were treated as modular entities where a module is at least 100 amino acids, carries a biological function, and has an independent evolutionary history.
Also, tissue specificity as it is deduced from cDNA library history does not provide information about the expression in specific cells of the tissue (for example [ 49]).
In general, the major clades of rice LTR retrotransposons are more closely related to elements present in other species than to the other clades of rice elements, suggesting that horizontal transfer may have occurred over the evolutionary history of rice LTR retrotransposons.
Evolutionary history and diversification of the PRC-barrels
Modifications are time-stamped and associated with the curator's name, providing a complete history of the annotation.
Unlike many other organisms, Drosophila has a genetic history reaching back to 1910, and an enormous amount of data to tie to the sequence.
This history of research has culminated in a rich understanding of the pattern and process of molecular evolution in the genus Drosophila [ 7].
Together with the changes in base composition in both coding and non-coding sequences noted above, the increased rate of evolution in both coding and non-coding sequences detected in the D. willistoni suggests a genome-wide effect, possibly resulting from a change in mutation pressure or a change in population size at some time during the history of this lineage (see also [ 37]).
Much less is known of the domain architecture and evolutionary history of those viral DNA-binding regulatory proteins whose cellular homologs have not (yet) been identified.
Here we describe the functional predictions and evolutionary history of these viral regulatory proteins and their cellular homologs that were detected as a result of these analyses.
The domain architecture and evolutionary history of GOLD-domain proteins: functional implications
This could be a straightforward approach to reconstructing the evolutionary history of gene fusions, if only the topology of the species trees was well resolved.
Therefore, we concentrated on the evolutionary histories of gene fusions that are shared by at least two of the three primary kingdoms.
Thus, the history of this pair of fusion-linked COGs appears to involve horizontal transfer of the fused gene between bacteria and archaea (and possibly also within kingdoms), as well as at least one additional, independent fusion event in bacteria.
The fusion-linked COGs 1605 and 0077 (chorismate mutase and prephenate dehydratase, respectively) show a more complicated history, with distinct fusion events resulting in different domain architectures (see legend to Figure 4).
We have analyzed the sequences of genes encoding GshA and GshB and have discovered that the evolutionary history of these genes is more complex than expected.
Our analysis of the sequences of GshAs and GshBs suggests that the evolutionary history of these proteins is more complex than expected on the basis of the distribution of GSH in extant organisms.
Therefore, we must consider the evolutionary history of the two genes separately.
Other pseudogenes may have been inactivated relatively recently in evolutionary history, and may show substantial codon-preserving bias accumulated over the evolutionary period during which the gene was functional.
We sought to understand the evolutionary history of the proteins involved in cell-wall dynamics, because such an analysis could throw light on the emergence and diversification of this uniquely bacterial structure.
However, the modern era of genomics has been accompanied by increasingly numerous claims that LGT is frequent [ 3, 4, 5, 6], and there now seems little doubt that LGT exerts a significant influence upon evolutionary histories.
If correct, this allows the optimistic viewpoint that the complex interplay of vertical gene descent and LGT can be deciphered to yield correct evolutionary histories, provided that sufficiently detailed studies are done.
Alien genes that may be subject to possible LGT can generally expect a hostile reception in that they lack a history of functional integration with the resident genome.
This conclusion is encouraging as it shows that both vertical and horizontal events of gene transfer can be deduced to track evolutionary history.
The natural history of vertebrates suggests that there were multiple solutions to the problem of CSD.
The identification of multiple Kv3 channel genes, but only single members of the Kv1, Kv2 and Kv4 families, in Diptera (two in Drosophila and three in Anopheles ) raises questions about the evolutionary history of Kv3 K +channel genes.
The same tree topology was supported by both neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood trees, though lack of a clear ortholog from a more distant organism (for example, a deuterostome) makes this type of assessment, regarding gene history, more difficult.
The high level of amino-acid sequence identity, as well as the conservation of intron-exon boundaries, in combination with the chromosomal proximity of these genes in Anopheles and Drosophila , provides a greater understanding of the molecular diversity and evolutionary history of K +-channel genes in the order Diptera.
Each subject underwent a structured, computer-assisted telephone interview covering demographic characteristics, smoking history, asthma history, symptoms, and treatment, health status, health care utilization for asthma, and insurance for asthma care.

There were no statistical differences in history of ever smoking (43% of participants in both interviews versus 37% of non-participants at follow-up), female gender (73% versus 66%), atopic history (82% versus 83%), or severity-of-asthma scores (11.
There were no statistical differences in history of ever smoking (43% of participants in both interviews versus 37% of non-participants at follow-up), female gender (73% versus 66%), atopic history (82% versus 83%), or severity-of-asthma scores (11.
Current and prior cigarette smoking history was assessed using questions adapted from the National Health Interview Survey [ 28].
We previously developed and validated a 13-item disease-specific severity-of-asthma score with four subscales: frequency of current asthma symptoms (daytime or nocturnal), use of systemic corticosteroids, use of other asthma medications (besides systemic corticosteroids), and history of hospitalizations and intubations [ 23, 24, 25].
As a result, the hospitalization and intubation subscale now reflects only prior history of intubation.
Atopic history was defined by a reported history of allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis.
Atopic history was defined by a reported history of allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis.
Because prior work suggests an unexpectedly high prevalence of aspirin intolerance in persons with near fatal asthma [ 29], we ascertained any history of aspirin sensitivity at baseline interview.
Our results suggest that simple demographic and clinical features, especially low income, non-white race, previous hospitalization history, systemic corticosteroid use, and reliance on emergency department for urgent asthma care, can identify such high-risk patients for more intensive therapy.
These difficulties support further inquiry into relevant legislative history to help determine the meaning of the presence requirement.
Legislative History.
The legislative history of the presence requirement in the Corporation's appropriations and the applicable H-2A provisions in the Immigration Reform and Control Act confirm that Congress intended to provide meaningful representation to eligible aliens, including H-2A workers on claims arising from their employment contract; and that Congress did not understand the presence requirement to severely alter or restrict this representation.
Upon careful consideration of the findings of fact, the language and purposes of the statute and the legislative history, the Commission has determined that none of these formulations fully responds to the purposes of the statute or the intent of Congress.
Together, the language, purpose, and legislative history of the applicable statutes, and the factual record before the Commission, suggest an interpretation of the statute that would authorize the following representation:
Workers thus are socially isolated, having no support systems of family or friends, and no familiarity, contacts, or shared history with the communities where they are located.
The USDOL lacks adequate resources to enforce its regulations, April Testimony at 57 (testimony of Jack Londen, Attorney at Law), and has a long history of weak enforcement of the H-2A program.
B. Legislative History
The legislative history provides assistance in analyzing the presence requirement.
The legislative history reveals no explanation for this change.
The new language received virtually no discussion; nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended to adopt new or more stringent restrictions on alien representation.
The legislative history establishes that legal representation for H-2A workers was a crucial part of the legislative compromise that established the H-2A program.
The creation of the H-2A program was controversial, given the history of prior temporary agricultural programs such as the Bracero program.
The fact is the history of the abuses in that H-2 program, which has been documented time and time again, cannot be corrected without effective representation, as you could easily contemplate guest workers coming here for a short period of time, hoping to come back again, anxious to pick up a wage considerably higher than the wage they might be making in their own country, have no individual ability and no effective collective ability to enforce the protections that the U.S. law is supposed to guarantee them.
The legislative history of IRCA makes clear that Congress intended for LSC recipients to provide meaningful legal representation to H-2A workers on matters arising under the employment contract.
The legislative history contains no evidence that Congress believed it was limiting legal representation of H-2A workers to the period when such workers were physically present in the United States.
This legislative history suggests that Congress, with full knowledge that H-2A workers were only in the United States on a temporary basis, intended that their rights under their H-2A contracts be protected by being given access to meaningful legal services.
The legislative history of the 1996 revision contains no discussion of the "present in the United States" requirement and no indication that Congress sought to alter existing practice regarding the representation of aliens.
Neither the language nor the legislative history of the statute suggest that Congress intended to alter the application of the presence requirement.
In sum, the legislative history of the presence requirement confirms that Congress intended to provide meaningful representation to eligible aliens, including H-2A workers on claims arising from their employment contract; and that Congress did not understand the presence requirement to severely alter or restrict this representation.
22 Upon careful consideration of the language and purposes of the statute and the legislative history, the Commission has determined that none of these formulations fully responds to the purposes of the statute or the intent of Congress.
The legislative history contains no evidence that Congress intended LSC representation of legal permanent residents and other aliens to turn on the accident of where an alien happened to be at the moment the cause of action arose or the litigation commenced, or to require the alien to be continuously physically present throughout the course of representation.
Together, the language, purpose, and legislative history of the applicable statutes, and the factual record before the Commission, suggest an interpretation of the statute that would authorize the following representation:
The language and legislative history of the LSC appropriations acts and the H-2A statute make clear that Congress intended to provide meaningful legal representation to aliens in the designated categories, and there is no evidence that Congress considered the presence requirement to severely restrict this interpretation.
It is well settled that a history of practice under a statute can aid in its interpretation, particularly when Congress has amended the statute without disapproving of the administrative practice.
The Commission's interpretation is the only interpretation which comports with the language and legislative history of the presence requirement and which permits full and meaningful representation to aliens eligible for legal assistance consistent with Congress' purpose.

NHTSA's legal interpretation is supported by the language and legislative history of section 330.
The legislative history of section 330, taken as a whole, suggests that the fundamental purpose of this provision was to prevent an anticipated increase in the CAFE standards.
In this context, the references in the history to requiring an identical standard or precluding any changes for 1998 may have been based on the assumption that the outcome of any change would be an increase in the standard.

Roger Schonfeld's book draws out many of the significant points about JSTOR's place in the history of electronic publication through a minute examination of the process leading to JSTOR as it is today.
I sympathise with Roger Schonfeld in attempting to write such a comprehensive history, but what is the point of appearing to be comprehensive when comprehensiveness is an impossible goal?
Would a briefer history have been just as valuable?
Leaving aside quibbles and caveats about the book and about JSTOR, this remains a fascinating and instructive history of an important and ground-breaking initiative.
An accident of history, however, selectively wiped out all the male bullies of his main study troop.
The conclusion from this natural experiment is that, like human societies, each animal society has its own ecological and behavioral history, which determines its prevalent social style.
This is the great shift which has taken place in the history of risk….
At least, that was the guess of researchers working on the natural history and nutrition of the deer, which became listless and showed signs of depressed mood, hanging their heads and lowering their ears.
To highlight the many seminal contributions of plant scientists to the field, we offer here a personal perspective on the origins and history of RNA-mediated gene silencing in plants.
The history of gene silencing research shows once again that plants offer outstanding experimental systems for elucidating general biological principles.
The novelty here is that selection on one locus depends on the history of gene frequencies at the other, “niche construction”, locus.
Courts already consider other factors, such as a history of child abuse, in an attempt to more fully understand the psychological state of the defendant.
The latter process uses DNA to record the history of a series of chemical reactions by cosynthesizing a portion of a DNA oligonucleotide during each step of a molecule's solidphase synthesis.

Citing a history of racism, including the historically well-documented Tuskegee Syphilis Study, Reid asks rhetorically whether genetics research will result in a “genetically modified” white upper class and a lower, dark-skinned “natural birth class”?
We only need to look to history as our proof.
In the history of the planet, there has never been anything as productive of life as a wheat field in Kansas.

But it is at least as likely that the microbial world, resentful at being either ignored or exterminated, will come up with something to consign us to a footnote in the history of life when it is ultimately written by the silicon entities.
It is crucial that our evolving knowledge of “genomic recycling” be used to enhance our understanding of the evolution of humans, not only in the context of “descendants of ancient apes,” but in the larger context of our fundamental unity and shared genetic history with all other species.
We don't know which features of Earth life are essential and which are just accidents of history.
In particular, the most common and destructive pathogens faced by humans and other mammals are RNA viruses, such as influenza A, yellow fever, and hepatitis C. In most cases, our ability to survive these viral infections is simply a combination of good luck and good breeding; with the right combination of MHC alleles, itself a function of population history and what we by chance inherit from our parents, some individuals may be more able to fight off viral infections than others.
Nowhere in the history of evolution has sustainability ever been naturally selected for,’ says du Toit.
A ban in the 1866s by the French Academy of Sciences on publications about the origin of human language must have been one of the strangest bans in the history of sciences.

Throughout evolutionary history, there will be variability and heritability in flower colour (as documented for 
Given the long history of use of molecular markers (e.g.
, see the February 2003 issue of Trends in Ecology and Evolution ). The former view reflects a real need to connect different life history stages and to increase the precision and efficiency of field studies involving diverse and difficult-to-identify taxa.
The history of modern computing is very brief and (at least judging by the sales) very glorious, and this story is most entertaining.
The second, and rather less satisfying, book is about the philosophy of mind and the history of artificial intelligence and neural network approaches to understanding the brain and replicating cognition.
Historical mechanisms are those that suggest that earth history (e.g.
, the opening of the Drake Passage and the cooling of Antarctica) and phylogenetic history have played major roles in generating current patterns in diversity, and tend to emphasise regional (and especially longitudinal) differences therein (Qian and Ricklefs 2004; Ricklefs 2004).
If differences in climates do cascade upwards to influence individuals, species, and broader scale patterns in diversity, their influence should be readily detectable at the level of species' life histories and distributions.
In birds, large-scale geographic variation in life history variables, such as the incidence of cooperative breeding, extent of parental care, survival, and the timing of reproduction, has been studied for at least the past 50 years, and the mechanisms underlying this variation have been much debated.
Insect life histories also show hemisphere-related variation.
They ascribe this difference to the warmer and less thermally variable conditions of the southern hemisphere, which, as we have already noted, have considerable effects on species life histories.
Despite considerable spatial complexity, there do seem to be regular north–south differences in species life histories and patterns of range size variation that are consistent with disparities in the climates of the two hemispheres (Figure 6).
First, both phylogenetically independent and non-independent comparisons of life history traits and physiological variables across a variety of groups are required.
Moreover, replicated studies using similar methods might substantially improve the signal-to-noise ratio, which can be weakened in “macrophysiological” or large-scale life history and physiological comparisons by the fact that different methods often lead to different outcomes.
The outstanding milestone in the early history of biological quantitation was the work of William Harvey, Exercitatio Anatomica De Motu Cordis et Sanguinis In Animalibus (An Anatomical Disquisition on the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals) (Harvey 1847), first published in 1628.
For example, game theory has a history before the work of John von Neumann (von Neumann 1959; von Neumann and Morgenstern 1953), and Karl Pearson's development of the correlation coefficient (Pearson and Lee 1903) rested on earlier work by Francis Galton (1889).
These relatively recent events should be a good model for working out how similar events affected genetic diversity throughout evolutionary history.
“We took some dust from the top of the natural history museum in Oxford, extracted [DNA], used their supposedly halospecific primers and extracted a whole bunch of sequences, including some that fell within their diversity.”
“As no information was provided on the sample's handling history,” says Gilbert, “it becomes impossible for a reader to decide whether the sequences are authentic or contaminant” (Box 2).
However, in spite of the continual problem of eager but inexperienced biologists trying to extract DNA from specimens in the university museum, there is a sense that aDNA is starting to fill in the gaps in our understanding of key moments in evolutionary history.
The field of molecular phylogeography, which documents the history of spatial isolation and geographic expansion of populations, has developed.
, opportunities for founder events) in the history of recently formed species.
“Many of the key species that govern ecosystem dynamics in the Antarctic have life histories that depend on the availability of winter sea ice.
This evidence came from Fraser's own studies, over the past 30 years, of three Antarctic penguin species that share similar life histories (including a penchant for krill) but show striking contrasts in their relationship to the sea ice (Figure 2).
With a life history accustomed to the formation of sea ice at critical points in their life cycle, Adélies are finding themselves faced with an unpredictable sea ice cycle that outpaces their ability to adapt.
“Adélies don't seem capable of adjusting anything about their life history,” says Fraser.
One comes away from the exhibit with a sense of the power of raw imagery that one may not have felt since the grade-school days of reading illicit comics when one was supposed to be learning the dates of battle sequences through history.
The world that animals perceive is not an objective, veridical representation of the physical world, he argued, but is instead a product of the particular sense organs that each species has acquired in its evolutionary history [1].

It is only with proper awareness of the natural history of the disease that one can make rational judgments regarding who needs treatment.
Academic medical centers like our own have played a particularly important role in the history of medical discovery; the hallmark of these institutions is our commitment to thinking and reflecting about the patients we see, patients who are often extremely sick and whose management is exceptionally complex.
There are two main reasons why certain trials are not published: one is that the pharmaceutical industry has a long history of suppressing data that are commercially unfavorable and the second is that medical journals and the popular media favor publication of positive over negative trials (after all, negative trials do not make for a provocative newspaper headline).

While we acknowledge that our practice pattern is by no means a standard-of-care requirement, we feel it is a reasonable approach to this dilemma until larger, prospective observational studies have been conducted to better elucidate the natural history of these high-risk pregnancies and to better answer the question of when the ideal gestational age is to deliver apparently uncomplicated monochorionic twins.
Family history of premature coronary artery disease is a major but underused risk factor.
A nonsmoker, she lacked a relevant family history and was vigorously athletic.
In the remaining 70% of the postings, group members provided each other with what amounted to a crash course in their shared disease, discussing topics such as the anatomy, physiology, and natural history of the disorder; treatment options and management guidelines for each form of treatment; and treatment side effects, medical self-management, the day-to-day practicalities of living with the disease, and the effects of their condition on family and friends (Table 1).
, place and season of birth) [7], the size of the odds ratio for family history suggests that searching for the familial determinants of schizophrenia is rational for etiological research.

So Chatterbox will pass over these excellent entries, taking the advice of contest entrant Jonathan Weisberg to look for a name that might at least conceivably wind up in a high-school history book.
Several other entries also fail the "history book" test.
But Chatterbox believes neither Starr nor Linda Tripp will go down in history as the scandal's central figures--although "Trippwire," submitted by at least four readers, actually packs quite a bit of info about the scandal into a small package.
That's been true through most of human history.
America, in this sense, is a conspiracy against human nature--and not just in that we expect monogamy when the rule of history has been polygamy.
I also want to ask you for help in reading the Wall Street Journal 's front-page account of Mark Barton's online-trading history.
Court papers filed by attorneys for Mary Moran, the congressman's estranged wife, allege that the northern Virginia legislator had a history of "wasting the family assets on his stock market gambling."
Given her history of financial scandal, she'd be a fool to do anything improper).
Therefore, it's rash to conclude (as Chatterbox did) that the second -hottest temperature in known human history was the 134 degrees recorded in Death Valley--cited by NOAA as the hottest-ever temperature in North America, and as a temperature hotter than any other recorded by NOAA for any continent that isn't Africa.
More likely, the second- hottest day in known human history probably occurred somewhere in Africa, where somebody probably measured a temperature of 135 degrees Farenheit.
No woman in New York history has ever been elected to a statewide post more august than lieutenant governor.

5 million at the box office and set a record for the largest per-screen gross in motion-picture history, the major movie studios responded by commissioning studies to explain to them why this $50,000 film was crushing all their hundred-million-dollar spectaculars.
They're playing it as a breakthrough-in-marketing story--small-time filmmakers hit on big-time strategy--when it's actually the oldest marketing story in the history of culture: scaring and delighting audiences and making oneself rich and famous by pushing back the boundaries of what is commonly thought of as realistic.
History has falsified that premise.
Twelve years of Reagan-Bush plus eight of Clinton took care of that, along with the longest peacetime economic expansion in American history.
Culturebox will appeal to history, that defense of scoundrels, to argue that television seems a pretty harmless way to distract children, at least when you compare it to the alternatives.
I'm sure, as the details emerge, we're going to read a lot stories about the whacked cultural and political climate of our country that allows a man with such a history to get ahold of not just a gun, but a vanful of weapons.

Conducted by the congressional General Accounting Office, a preliminary investigation of 531 Pentagon security checks claims that 92 percent are incomplete, and that in 12 percent of cases the Defense Department failed to follow leads pointing to financial problems, criminal histories, and alcohol and drug abuse.
He tells the history of rock anecdotally--through a few dozen isolated vignettes--and conventionally.
One of the striking differences between this rock history and others is that Miller looks at rock as being over --since roughly 1977, we've had nothing but reprises of old themes.
It's a strange rock history indeed whose pivotal chapter concerns David Bowie, but here you have it.
Covering a record that the London Times cultural critic called "a decisive moment in the history of Western civilization," must have been a heady enterprise indeed--especially if you bought the hype.
Clinton is one of the more anti-civil-libertarian presidents in modern history.
The bottom line (probably not my best metaphor in this context) is the success of the corporate elite and free-market ideologues in pushing the "end of history" idea--that in a post-Communist world there is no alternative to our present economic and social system, like it or not.
As a critical theorist himself, Miller must know how subjective his rock narrative is (even the jump-cut structure suggests it), yet he still seems to present pop music as the product of the same shared, single history.
He gives us a history of the term "oldies but goodies," and mentions "In the Still of the Night," scarcely noticed when it came out in 1956, but by 1959 a staple of the oldies circuit.
Perhaps rock history is like retrospective politics.
If history is written by the winners, is rock history written by the losers?

The two-column NYT exclusive reports that investigators may have cracked one of the largest money-laundering operations in U.S. history: Investigators say that a notorious Russian mob figure, Semyon Yukovich Mogilevich, may have filtered $10 billion through the Bank of New York since early 1998.

The great bitches of entertainment history understood this.
Austin was a brilliant, sharp-tongued, and of course, being a bitch, somewhat manipulative heart surgeon, but instead of enjoying the occasional triumph over her supercilious colleagues, she just had more bad stuff happen to her than maybe anyone else in nighttime soap history.
Answers range from "in fact, there isn't any evidence [that the feds started the fire]" (Brit Hume, Fox News Sunday ) to "we're talking about an event unparalleled in American history" (Mark Shields, PBS's Newshour With Jim Lehrer ). (Shields compares the impact of Waco on the American psyche to that of the Kennedy assassination.)
First, a little personal history.
Or worse, some sort of illegitimate attempt by the paper to revise its history of coverage on the subject?
Where Timberg looks at McCain's career in relation to the Naval Academy, Vietnam, and the Reagan era, McCain examines his own history in the more personal context of his family's military tradition.
In George W.'s case, however, there's a little history to the relationship.
That's not surprising, since at this point in the history of marketing, it seems impossible that you might actually come across something new.
Let me depart with some personal history that readers who wish to can find in my memoir Parallel Time: Growing Up in Black and White . I was recruited to college off of a street corner in a dying factory town where black boys were traditionally channeled into dead-end vocational jobs.

A brief for isolationism, the book includes a pocket history of "Jewish Influence" in U.S. foreign policy from 1917 to the present.
Fernandina is exactly the type of town that Celebration would emulate: close, old, quaintly Victorian, rife with sidewalks, history, and pedestrians, and all the forms of old-style American community.
As I took Celebration to task for its faux history and democracy, I reflected back on Fernandina, which was, whatever else might be "Peyton Place-ish," at least a real community, the product of hundreds of years of conflicts bloodier by far than Parent vs.

A Short History of Washington Week: Paul Duke reminisces with his panelists and welcomes new host Gwen Ifill.

The book is after all subtitled "The secret history of the American meritocracy," which arouses the suspicion that there is something disreputable that has been kept secret and will now be revealed.
But of course the large outline of this history of how academic qualifications became the key consideration for college and university admissions isn't very secret at all--it's been told by Christopher Jencks and David Riesman in The Academic Revolution , more than 30 years ago, and in other studies of American higher education, and part of the story is also told in The Bell Curve , as you suggest.
Indeed, even in the early '70s Jews were not all convinced that this was only history.
So it made sense for Lemann to move from the history of ETS to the history of affirmative action, as it affected higher education admissions.
So it made sense for Lemann to move from the history of ETS to the history of affirmative action, as it affected higher education admissions.
He tells this story in a rather different way from the history of ETS, with an emphasis on the role of some activists, lawyers and others, who entered college and university at a time when meritocratic considerations were not yet affected in a major way by racial considerations, and when a number of young Japanese- and Chinese-Americans had opportunities to attend elite schools they would probably have not been able to in the pre-meritocratic age.
By any meaningful measure of economic performance, the dominant U.S. technology companies today are among the most successful and profitable in the history of the world.

He has abrogated his moral responsibility to history in a manner that is close to unforgivable.
Here, for example, is Morris' riff on the extraordinarily complicated 60-year history of the modern American welfare state: "Under the 1935 Social Security Act, a family on welfare was re-classified as 'self-supporting' the moment Pop was hired ...
I don't think much of Reagan's economic policies, although I concede that some good things flowed from them; but whatever one thinks of them, they do mark an extraordinarily important moment in American history.
Or maybe not so unified, since, although I still don't agree with you about Miramax, I see that I agree even less with myself, in that I don't actually think that the political protests of Catholic, feminist, and gay-rights organizations regarding their portrayals by the mass media are really of comparable weight, seeing as only one of these special interests is allied with an extraordinarily wealthy institution with one of the most coherent and cooperative global network of outlets in history.
What if Reagan was intelligent and perceptive, far more imaginative than all his critics put together, infinitely more resourceful in implementing his agenda, eerily indifferent to much of the acrimony and pettiness around him, resolute and far-sighted in keeping his eye on the long ball of history?
And so Morris finds himself set on his disastrous course that takes up a decade and a half of his life, ruins his reputation, and does a grave injustice to Reagan and to history.
As I noted yesterday, Morris seems to know very little about American politics and American history.
I mentioned yesterday his preposterous summary of the history of the welfare state, which sounds like one of Reagan's uninformed anecdotes about welfare queens and his uninformed analysis of Keynesianism and the New Deal economic order.
People in the Reagan administration, Reagan partisans, and Reagan himself have had obvious self-serving reasons for making such arguments--for insisting that a major event in world history that arose out of a vast confluence of factors was the result of the policies and the rhetoric of a single man.
But it is also an injustice to history, because it accepts far too credulously the claims made by Reagan's admirers about his accomplishments and his influence.
You have ruined our chance to make history by achieving almost complete unanimity.
I think history will vindicate that judgment.
But Morris, in his simplistic way, and you, in your much more knowledgeable way, go much too far, I think, in your claims about Reagan's importance to history.
On the other hand, the economic boom of the '80s and the '90s is unlike any previous economic boom in American history in creating a very substantial upward distribution of wealth and in benefiting those on the bottom 50 to 60 percent of the economic ladder very little, if at all.
Sonia Gandhi's Congress Party was dealt the worst defeat in its history.
That includes The Flounder , published in the United States in 1978, an epic disquisition on the perfidy of women (Grass' leftism does not extend to feminism) that is narrated by a fish and continues through centuries, with asides on matters of sexual and culinary history.
The German critic Hans Magnus Enzensberger has written of how Grass ranges with masterly skill from high-flown parodies of Catholic litany to the impersonal tone of case histories to slang to dialect and so on.
But like Grass himself, what once seemed a masterwork has been overtaken by history.

Diaz says that Ellis was arrested in 1988 in what the Drug Enforcement Administration called "the largest methamphetamine bust in history" (an interesting statistic that Diaz failed to drop in his interview with Ellis), and that Ellis "pleaded guilty to a reduced charge, using a telephone 'to facilitate a drug trafficking offense.
We have a long history of encouraging non-English speakers living or settling in the United States to give up their first language.
Although it was the third worst in U.S. history, it was still weaker than expected and smaller than last month's trade deficit.
The NYT reports inside that President Clinton seized on Dole's announcement to take a shot at George W.

"The herd," as Lewis puts it, had followed Clark into ITV, while Clark headed off in a new direction: "It was one of the greatest unintentional head fakes in the history of technology."

Nicholas Lemann's absorbing new history of American meritocracy, The Big Test , contains an interesting anecdote about William F. Buckley's inadvertent role, while an undergraduate at Yale during the late 1940s, in helping that university restrict the number of Jews and Catholics it admitted.
When Chatterbox asked Buckley about this intriguing story--which apparently has never been told before, except in a footnote to Dan A. Oren's 1985 book Joining The Club: A History of Jews and Yale --Buckley was a little hazy about the details:

Since Bush's history with Rainwater has already been much discussed in Texas (Ann Richards once said that Rainwater "owned" Dubya), the Times seems to simply be recycling old Texas news for a national audience.
In reviewing this history, it's important to make some crucial distinctions.
From this point on, anybody who undertakes any sort of American literary history will have to come to terms with Powell's achievement--15 more-or-less mature novels; close to a dozen plays, hundreds of short stories, book reviews, and occasional pieces; a magnificent diary that spans 35 years; and well over a thousand letters.

Judge [Starr], I'm wondering what you think about the famous moment on the South Lawn of the White House on the day of the impeachment when Vice President Gore stepped to the lectern and said that history would remember President Clinton, in his view, as one of the greatest presidents we've ever had.
By this I mean something more than just the obvious point, which is that history has no control group.
Steve Roberts ( Late Edition ) thinks that Bush is alluding to his family's history of honorable public service.
He said it was "fine by me, but most big decisions in modern history have been taken without reference to Parliament and so I suppose that one chamber is as easy to bypass as two."
Philip Morris filed a $10 billion libel suit-- the biggest libel suit in U.S. history --against ABC over the broadcast.
If British telecom giant Vodafone succeeds in its attempted hostile takeover of German telecom giant Mannesmann, the deal will be, by some measures, the biggest deal in history (non-inflation, non-bull-market-adjusted, that is).
The NYT explains that the FTC assented to the $81 billion Mobil-Exxon merger, the largest in history, after the two giants agreed to the largest divestiture the agency has ever seen.
All three papers note that the game drew the largest crowd for a football game in Texas history.
Assignments in black studies have filtered down to the high-school, junior-high, and even elementary-school level (and remember the black liturgical occasions we now have on the calendar that beg for special schoolchild reports of one sort or another: the King holiday, Black History Month, Black Music Month, Kwanzaa, Malcolm X's birthday, Juneteenth), and while not every school does all of this, most schools must do some of this.
Moreover, blacks cannot be left out of Women's History Month or Veteran's Day or, for the truly daring, Gay Appreciation Month.
But I would think that most black-studies scholars are only partly heartened by this; for this rather triumphalist book (and Gates is important in black studies, in part, for the promotion of a triumphalist view of black history and black culture--globally speaking--which is why he is hated by Afrocentrists who take a somewhat different view of the long-term meaning of "the coming of the white man") is nothing less than the middlebrow arrival of black studies in American culture.
But I suppose it is something of a triumph, which the publication of this book is meant to acknowledge, that black studies has achieved middlebrow status in the United States, that bourgeois people, both white and black, feel bad if they don't know something about the history and culture of African-descended people, in much the same way they feel bad, inadequate, if they don't know something about opera or a bit about Impressionist painting or if they have never seen a film by D. W. Griffith or Fritz Lang.
More triumphalist history!)
But the history of the publication of this book is only incompletely told by the editors.
I'm less sanguine that many whites feel bad when they don't know something about black history and culture.
Years ago, a white woman told me about how her son's teacher let the class dance to a Michael Jackson record for 10 minutes to celebrate Black History Month.
Black history--in America, at least--is American history.

The Human Relations Commission was very important in the history of race relations in the city in the 1950s and 1960s, although it was a group without strong enforcement abilities.
It may not be the greatest comeback in business history, but the re-ascendance of OPEC is certainly one of the more surprising turnarounds in recent memory.
The history of OPEC, at least since the mid-1980s, has been one of massive cheating on the part of its members, who have regularly violated their production quotas in order to reap as much profit as possible.
Africana is as least as good as the two or three other encyclopedias of black history and culture that sit in storage while I wait for my shoulder to heal enough so I can build bookshelves.
When I look at our place in American history, though, what intrigues me are the missed opportunities--as when, for example, legal and societal distinctions were first made between white indentured servants and black slaves.

The way we talk about the character of leaders has come a long way since Leo Tolstoy railed against Carlyle's great-man theory of history 130 years ago in War and Peace : "To study the laws of history, we must entirely change the subject of our observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and study the common, infinitesimally small elements that influence the masses."

Since then, history has been through a host of determinisms--economic, demographic, biological, geographic, even meteorological--each meant to relegate the individual psychology of great men to the realm of the contingent.
That '96 race is worth recalling for another reason you mentioned: At no other time in the history of American politics have both halves of a presidential ticket referred to themselves so frequently in the third person.

1. "The same day that the merger between Exxon and Mobil, the largest industrial merger in history , was approved by the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC moved to block the merger between BP Amoco and Arco . Apparently, that deal will result in higher gas prices in California and the West, while the Exxon-Mobil deal will merely result in the creation of the third-largest company in the world."

If Birdwhistell, in his travels, had been looking not for smiles but for smirks , Chatterbox strongly suspects he would have found lots of them on the smile-barren East Coast, especially in the vicinity of its prep schools and Ivy League universities . Here's a thought experiment: Summon up a mental image of Ali McGraw, the smirkiest performer in the history of the movies.
Since I believe that "normal" Western politics is the politics of platitudes (and looking at Russia, perhaps we should not knock that), I am going to pick up my theme of our democratic, domestic rhetoric and come back to your turf, that of history, in a reverse manner.

What impresses me, in fact, is that with all the blather about "the new," there is a hunger for history, and for many people, the old is more relevant than the new.
And I think, earlier this year, of Serbia, where the bones of Prince Lazar, the martyr of the battle against the Turks in 1389, have become hallowed in history and whose legends were written down by church scribes and canonized in cycles of folk poetry.

What has interested me, as a professional historian, about the media's coverage of the subject so far, has been how relatively little attention has been paid to the history of the planet between 1000 and 2000.

The paper quotes Gingrich's assessment of the Clinton administration as engaged in "the most systematic, deliberate obstruction of justice cover-up and effort to avoid the truth we have ever seen in American history, and the time has come to say to the president, 'Quit undermining the law in the United States.
The lawsuits, modeled on those successfully brought by several state governments in recent years, constitute, in the words of the LAT , a "major new assault" in what is already history's costliest collection of cases.

It calls the move against Microsoft, "one of the sharpest legal attacks on big business in this century," and accompanies its lead with an interesting graphic depicting the relative market shares enjoyed by American history's other celebrated anti-trust targets, IBM, AT&T, and Standard Oil.
The case, says the paper, could result in the largest fine in EPA history.
Not if you think an art museum should be like a history museum, treating art as a cultural artifact that illustrates the story of a particular person, period, and place.
One early critic of this trend, Sherman Lee, then director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, complained 20 years ago that NEH "tends to lose sight of the fundamental purpose of an art exhibition, which is not to illustrate history but to allow an art work to be understood and enjoyed as a work of art."
Art history has flickered out, he says, and though art will continue to be made, each artist will follow his or her bliss, without any larger motive or connective scheme.
Walker makes History painting, that musty patriarchal fossil, seem like the most seditious and vital new idea of the 21 st century.

Licklider may be the most influential little-known person in the history of computer science.
Hafner, a contributing editor at Newsweek and co-author with John Markoff of Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier , and Lyon, her husband and an assistant to the president of the University of Texas, have written an epic technological history.
Perhaps the greatest mystery in the history of the Internet is one about which Hafner and Lyon never bother to speculate--how and why the Pentagon, at the height of the backlash against the Vietnam War, was persuaded to grant a bunch of longhaired, Tolkien-reading grad students huge sums of money, without insisting on oversight.
Given the whiteness of those images and the long history of denying intellectual aptitude to African-Americans, it's surely good news that in America today, the word "intellectual" is as likely to evoke Cornel West as Susan Sontag.
The decision is a reflection, I think, not of his catering to fashion, but of the problem facing anyone whose aim is to write the first full history of African-American intellectuals: namely, that since the first African-Americans were slaves introduced largely for manual labor, intellectual activity is naturally not a large part of their record.
Indeed, Banks has written a useful survey of African-American scholars and writers and the ways in which they have worked throughout the history of the republic.
"Is it still distinctive or is it now just Topeka with more fried food, road kill, heat and history?"
Throughout, he displays a deft and lively grasp of Southern history and letters, popular culture and cuisine.
The book is liberally seasoned with wordplay and typographical experiments (the words "eat fat" are always in capitals, with "FAT" printed directly under "EAT," so you can see how similar the two words are) and rhymes ("why this should be so at this moment in history is a mystery.
Light though the sketching is, the historical argument is almost the most objectionable thing about the book, since it involves a distortion of the history of First Amendment law that is fairly plain even to someone who is not a professor at Yale Law School.
Why does Fiss portray the history of First Amendment jurisprudence in this perverted way?
He thinks the NEA should subsidize art that will enhance the "robustness" of the debate and should therefore prefer unorthodox art--though only, of course, if it represents a viewpoint the endowment considers, by virtue of social need and a prior history of exclusion, worthy of its megaphone.
One thing that is plain from the brief unhappy history of campus speech codes is that you automatically raise the value of the speech you punish and depress the value of the speech you sponsor.
The two stories further illustrate the unease, even hostility, that blacks have tended to feel about their folklore, and about black history generally: In "That I Had the Wings," Riley, a young black boy Ellison uses in several stories, hates his Aunt Kate and wishes she "had died back in slavery times"; in "Flying Home," the black pilot who seeks escape hates the black farmer who rescued him after his crash.
The Didion protagonist is a woman adrift in history, her own and America's.
--a woman adrift in history, her own and America's.
Didion's parables about anomie in post-Kennedy-era America have implied that once history is forgotten, identity dissolves and conspiracy--and the suspicion of it--is the only guide.
Scrutinized from the ground, which is where the narrator and Elena McMahon are, this history is not as random as it might seem.
He will live into posterity on the strength of the five films he made with the great German director Werner Herzog, Fitzcarraldo and particularly Aguirre, Wrath of God ; his Aguirre, the languidly nihilistic martinet who leads an Amazon expedition toward nothingness, is one of the great human monsters in movie history.
That the radical enthusiasms of 1968 left no permanent political imprint upon the Western democracies is a conclusion that a simple electoral history of the ensuing decades, the decades of Reagan, Thatcher, and Kohl, would seem sufficient to prove.
If, as Steiner claims, the greatness of a culture rests upon traditions, upon history, then America must be found wanting.
For the rest of us, a translation: What those tired and huddled masses that wash up on America's shores are tired of, specifically, is history.
In time, sugar became "the first imported luxury to become a cheap daily necessity of the masses," and, along with tea and tobacco, it "probably provide[s] us with the first instance in history of the mass consumption of imported food staples."
No one who reads these chapters will scoop up another spoonful of sugar without reflecting on the history of ambivalence, global turmoil, and centuries of suffering needed to put it on the table.
Still, this is a book whose bibliography includes monographs entitled Private Tooth Decay as Public Economic Virtue and tomes such as The History and Social Influence of the Potato --so the rest of it is still loaded with nuggets worth finding.
2 billion on its investment, one of the biggest losses in industry history.
In the same way that he knows to unearth the outtakes of the Clinton film bio, The Man From Hope, to mine it for details about the Clintons' relationship, I thought surely he would start to read American history seriously, so as to be able to mine it for historical perspective.

For roughly 85 percent of life's 3.5 billion-year history, it was entirely made up of single-celled organisms, such as bacteria and algae.
And for this biographer, "one of the most tasteful campaigns in the history of modern American politics"--Eastwood's run, as a property-rights Republican, for mayor of Carmel, Calif.--was one in which the star likened a civic ordinance that would ban second kitchens to "Adolf Hitler knocking on your door."
Will history judge the hero of Richard Schickel's Boswellian tome as "ironic" and "postmodern"?
Maren shows how this previously underreported history set the stage for the 1992 famine and the subsequent ill-fated American military intervention.
Scalia also rightly rejects the use of "legislative history" (committee reports and floor debates) as a guide to divining lawmakers' intent.
(Scalia quotes Judge Harold Leventhal's quip that using legislative history is like looking over the heads at a cocktail party until you spot your friends.)
After a long history of libertarian ideas, he proposes a version of Murray's basic argument, which he calls the "nonagression axiom"--no one can use force against anyone else.
Oddly, Personal History largely echoes Carol Felsenthal's unauthorized biography, Power, Privilege, and the Post: The Katharine Graham Story-- oddly, because its publication in 1993 incensed the Graham family.
Graham's aptly named book crosscuts between the engrossing social history of her life and times--populated by the likes of Marie Curie, Edward Steichen, Auguste Rodin, Thomas Mann, Bernard Baruch, Walter Lippmann, FDR, Truman Capote, LBJ, Jessica Mitford, Scotty Reston, Emperor Hirohito, Bill and Babe Paley, and Richard Nixon--and her agonizing personal history.

Personal History's false modesty begins to evaporate after Phil's suicide in 1963.
The roles he picked for himself were Dostoyevskian ones--the doppelgänger, playing unheeded guilty conscience to a modern Mephistopheles; the high-pitched prophet, trying to break what he saw as the "invincible ignorance" of a nation blinded to the "crisis of history" by its prosperity and misguided generous-mindedness.
For Hegel, history was a slaughter bench; for Chambers, it had become an emergency room.
The surrealist art world was like an opening onto a plane of reality that a middle-class unmarried son and brother, a commuter and breadwinner with solitary hobbies and an autodidact's knowledge of the history of theater, of opera, and of dance, might otherwise have never entered.
Not only can the devil cite scripture, but special pleaders can find in the open-textured words and often ambiguous history of these hastily drafted amendments almost anything they want to claim is the right (or left) approach.
On the question of whether the proposals of the truth school will denigrate other values more important than truth, we have a long history from which to learn.
Throughout our history, those who have sought the Holy Grail of truth have shown impatience with process.
He wrote kind reviews of books on Irish history and mythology by his friend Lady Gregory.
In this sober, incisive, and riveting book, a well-documented history rather than a novelistic evocation of the man himself, Roudinesco cannot conceal her dismay that Lacan was not better behaved, more temperate in his appetites, less baroque in his provocations.
Similarly, her title teases her readers, inviting us to draw parallels between her personal history and the story she tells in the novel, though she declines to supply the necessary details about her life.
Playful, ingenious revisions of orthodox history based on complex, covert affiliations and strange secret weapons are the master's trademark.
On the large stage of history, do these brave individuals shrink to statistical insignificance?
The stack before me now includes Theodore S. Hamerow's On the Road to the Wolf's Lair: German Resistance to Hitler (1997); Joachim Fest's Plotting Hitler's Death (1996); Nathan Stoltzfus' Resistance of the Heart: Intermarriage and the Rosenstrasse Protest in Nazi Germany (1996); and Peter Hoffmann's Stauffenberg: A Family History, 1905-1944 (1995).
History sometimes tells simple stories.
Hitler's death by his own hand cannot be counted as one of history's accidents.
Affirmative action, with its promise of government intervention to overcome the effects of discrimination, represented a willful refusal by blacks to accept "the main pattern of American history," the pattern of ever-expanding inclusiveness.
Multiculturalism is guilty of plenty of midsize wrongs, including bilingual instruction, which often keeps Spanish-speaking students locked in their own form of isolation, and the reduction of history to therapy, as Arthur Schlesinger put it.
In any case, as if still unsatisfied, around these tones Roth has orchestrated a still vaster range of side topics--ethnic sociology (Jews, blacks, Irish, WASPs, intermarriage), industrial history (glove-making craftsmanship and its decline, recounted at length), political debate (the crimes of Presidents Johnson and Nixon, the migraine rhetoric of Angela Davis), and more, some of it rendered with exquisite precision, which is fun to read.
Then he compounds his error by investing these background details with portentous meanings about America and its history, and he compounds the compound by overheating the plot (you will have to discover the details for yourself).
Peter Hoffmann has written good general histories of the resistance, but his Stauffenberg takes a new tack.
Conventional history can do nothing with Count Stauffenberg--this military aesthete who confused himself with a Holy Roman emperor and found reality in the musings of a visionary pederast.
History wants movements, tendencies, collective motion; Stauffenberg is merely Stauffenbergian.
Now--thanks to feminism, a general skepticism about the great man theory of history, and an even more general interest in the details of sexually adventurous lives--biographers are more likely to focus on women, less likely to care about their canonical status.
Soon she's writing "A Short History of the Slut."
And again: "Visual surprise is natural in the Caribbean; it comes with the landscape, and faced with its beauty, the sigh of History dissolves."
Well, maybe the sigh , but not the fact of history, as Walcott knows quite well.
The death of colonialism should be ranked among humanity's greatest accomplishments of the waning century, but the hard work was done at the end of World War II--an event that seems secure in its place in the history books even though Peter Jennings wasn't there to report it.
Thom touts her reliance on "oral histories of many founders and long-time staff members."
For the longest time, photography didn't have enough of a history to promote any fixed notions of what a picture should be or should show.
He inverts intellectual history, tracing 18 th -century European chimps' fascination with savage humans--Swift's Yahoos being a prime example--and the delusional arrogance with which "Western Civilization ...
In fact, the history of consulting is full of tales like these, showcasing the hubris, shortsightedness, and one-size-fits-all attitude of firms like McKinsey, Deloitte & Touche, and Andersen.
The history of management consulting, though, is more complex than these horror stories would suggest.
Unfortunately, little of this history makes its way into Dangerous Company , which is the first real study of consulting since business journalist Hal Higdon's 1969 work The Business Healers . Instead, the book is constructed--unintentionally or not--as a series of case studies that echo the teaching methods of Harvard Business School, prime consultant training ground.
American business, in fact, has a long history of bringing in outsiders to transform companies, though these outsiders haven't always been called consultants.
American history is widely interpreted as the pre-eminent refutation of Karl Marx's social and political theories.
Lacking a sizable middle class of farmers and shopkeepers (who would arrive only after World War I), and undergoing intense and rapid capitalist development, large portions of Colorado, Nevada, and Idaho became sharply polarized along class lines--"labor in one camp, the employers in another, no in-between camp, with government a football between the two," according to the final volume of John R. Commons and associates' venerable History of Labor in the United States .
célèbre populated by such larger-than-life characters as Haywood, Darrow, and McParland; all wrapped around a history lesson about the class bitterness of a century ago.
In this sense, Lukas' story may have been important as part of the struggle over the future of organized labor, but less so as a struggle over America's soul, at least when compared with the truly momentous Homestead and Pullman strikes of the 1890s, the Triangle Shirt Waist Co. fire of 1911, or any of the other more familiar set pieces of turn-of-the-century labor history.
Still, it is the rare author who can re-create, with so much passion and exactness, aspects of our history that most Americans would just as soon forget.
Stephan Thernstrom is professor of American history at Harvard University and Abigail Thernstrom, his wife a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a think tank.
Their book offers a history of black-white race relations since the late 19 th century; discusses racial controversies in a wide array of contexts (employment, housing, social-welfare programs, electoral politics, criminal justice); and prescribes a framework within which to fashion policy.
The critical moments in the history of those cities, he says, are the Los Angeles riots of 1965 and 1992; New York Mayor John Lindsay's attempt to forge a New Deal liberalism by expanding welfare and creating multicultural schools; New York's fiscal crisis; and the collapse of municipal service in Washington under Marion Barry.
There are three serious problems with his argument--first, an analysis that gives urban liberalism an unconvincing degree of importance in accounting for this decline; second, a methodology that picks out three cities that are not really representative; and third, an oddly unbalanced account of urban history that places ideologically motivated mayors, liberal intellectuals, and radical black activists center stage.
Moreover, Washington is never used in the urban literature as representative of anything other than itself--its history, governance, and economy are understood to be unique.
The remarkable fact is that his numbers have proven to be so robust and that the archive he assembled--of sexual history and sundry other material--remains unrivaled.
This is a man who, before he collected 18,000 sexual histories, spent 15 years collecting 300,000 gall wasps in order to argue, as he would again later, against the ontological reality of established taxonomic categories.
But, as the historian John Lukacs underscores in his study The Hitler of History , the Nazi dictator was not simply the century's most murderous tyrant; he was one of its most brilliant politicians.
In The Hitler of History , Lukacs adopts a more historiographical approach, examining, comparing, and correcting the interpretations of Hitler's biographers.
And yet, that shrewd critique of revisionism notwithstanding, Lukacs' own corrections to Hitler history are idiosyncratic and often wrong.
Indiana has composed not just an autopsy of Los Angeles trial spectacles but also a satire-before-the-fact of Dunne's novel--possibly the first such pre-emptive strike in literary history.
Still, Cassandra may be the most frustrating sibling in literary history.
How their dream cracked up, resulting in the pablum of today's PBS, and how PBS became Washington's most politically skittish organization, is the subject of James Ledbetter's brief history, Made Possible By ...
And when it stumbles onto a good subject for a series, like Ken Burns' history of baseball, it turns the show into a seminar on racism and labor relations, not the hit-and-run and the spitball.
All the records of life are there, the facts and figures and pocket histories, pointing up out of the ground, but what's buried there was never alive.
(He graduated from Oberlin College, was Ohio's first black lawyer, and would have been a familiar figure in the local history to which Morrison was exposed as a child.)
Morrison thickens the ambiguity by avoiding literal references to history and even physical descriptions that might fix characters in time and space.
The history is so little known--and so fascinating--it could easily have served as this novel's point of departure, or the spine of a novel all its own.
But I would love to see her talents turned to a cultural history of the eras and places she treats so compellingly in her novels.
Being a poem, it will want to escape these contradictions--to ignore them, to smooth them into plausible resolution or otherwise to smother the scandal of its roots in real history.
But the critique that follows is icy: We are warned that the poem admits to a sense of being "challenged or even edged aside by history" (it does no such thing), and that the title ("On First Looking Into Chapman's Homer") registers that "Keats felt he had come late to high culture."
But for historicism this is a poem that, in Motion's words, is "ambitious to transmute or escape history."
And history always seeps back in.
Historicism works on a moral hierarchy, in which political suffering is more important than metaphysical suffering or simply incorporates it, and in which "history" is more important than "time" or "life."
Pillar of Fire 's sprawl doesn't come from the kind of notebook-emptying self-indulgence that often clogs up journalistic histories.
Branch does place King at the center of his history, but Pillar of Fire is far too broad to be labeled a biography of one man.
People such as Johnson never imagined that history would remember them.
Cynthia Gorney's new history of the conflict over abortion could serve as an advertisement for an imperiled form of journalism: the long, meticulously researched narrative of ideas in which unglamorous noncelebrities drive the action.
It's not oral history; the author is there on every page, as enticed by vanity as any journalist is--maybe more so, because his is the kind of journalism that aspires most nakedly to the status of literature.
And when it comes to showing us the means by which everyday people are taken up by history, how they shape it and are in turn shaped by it, there is no genre more accommodating.
Gorney's setting is Missouri, which, as a microcosm for the history of abortion and the opposition to it over the last three decades, is an arbitrary choice; she seems to have chosen it mainly because her editors at the Washington Post sent her there in the late 1980s.
This is the kind of history that pro-lifers don't care to discuss, because it suggests the existence of a moral, as well as a political, dimension to abortion rights.
And pro-choicers are likely to ignore the abortion-abetting ministers because their own history of the movement puts feminist activists more or less alone on center stage.
Ajami, the author of The Arab Predicament , the classic 1981 intellectual history of modern Arab political thought, is probably the second most influential Arab-American public intellectual.
The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was "cruelly unfair," and the Whitewater investigation--led by "a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, "the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history."
History Lite
If you want your history books to be entertaining--full of anecdotes about the lives of the rich and the famous--Paul Johnson is the author for you.
A prolific British journalist-historian, Johnson is the author of many popular books, including Modern Times (1992) and A History of the Jews (1988), which explore the past in large sweeps.
While this ambitious and lengthy history of the American people gets bogged down here and there, it manages, for the most part, to move ahead at a lively pace.
When Johnson turns to the 19 th century, he continues to reward us with lively prose and well-crafted sketches of people--mostly presidents and big business leaders such as the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie and the banker J. Pierpont Morgan (this is decidedly a top-down history, in which the poor, labor union leaders, and minority groups receive far less attention than in most scholarly histories these days).

Statements such as these add a great deal of spice to Johnson's ambitious History . No one can accuse him of waffling.
Popular history need not come at the expense of thoughtful reflection and serious research, but Johnson's zingers are too often substitutes for those qualities.
This is a pity, for his caustic tone and shallow glosses undermine what is a bold and worthy effort: to write a readable one-volume history of the American people.
(Click for her arbitrary, brilliant take on literary history.)
Stein's attempt to show otherwise is a landmark in literature, a unique episode in the history of thought.
Wilson provides superb overviews of Western intellectual history and of the current state of understanding in many academic disciplines.
The interest was passed on, and Horwitz's father, a physician, kept his son up late at night reading from the 10-volume Photographic History of the Civil War . By third grade, Horwitz fils was completing his own "highly derivative" history of the war and commencing a Sistine-scale project: a mural of the war, pro-Rebel in slant, that would soon cover every inch of attic wall space.

One is a very bad book of social history, defined by Cohen's tendency to make up facts--"imagine" is his word--when he doesn't know something: "I do not know what [Yasha Katzenberg] looked like," he writes, "but I have tried to imagine him.
When Cohen is not "imagining" history, he rewrites other people's research, sometimes mangling quotes during his copying, as he did when he took a quote from a 1951 book, Murder, Inc.: The Story of "the Syndicate ," by , also about Jewish gangsters.
Cohen has written a book that he undoubtedly believes extols heroes and explains a suppressed bit of Jewish history, but what he has done is expose the architecture of his own pathology.
The presence of Bugsy Siegel and Kid Twist in our recent history does not mean we are a tough people.
Unfortunately, crude history will more likely reduce her to another role, as a pioneer of the he-said-she-said '90s.
"The whole history of Mexico, from the Conquest to the Revolution, can be regarded as a search for our own selves, which have been deformed or disguised by alien institutions," he wrote.
This is a poet's or a philosopher's approach to history that could fruitfully be applied to any country in the world.
That's one lesson of Hope in a Jar , a history of American beauty culture from the late-19 th to the mid-20 th century, a period when the pursuit of improved looks was transformed from a matter of folk recipes whispered from woman to woman to a multibillion dollar industry.
Walker and Annie Turnbo Malone, two of the best-known entrepreneurs in African-American history, were both daughters of slaves, orphaned as children, who began as purveyors of black women's hair potions.
Thirty years is less than the blink of an eye in human history.
He attacked the Los Angeles Police Department, the corporate boosters' whitewashing of city history, the absurd and isolating layout driven more by greed than geographical logic.
At one point Davis borrows Walter Benjamin's melancholy idea that history is a dialectical fairy tale--a bunch of contradictory stories people tell about themselves, "linked together by strange ironies."
A great mini-chapter on the history of Los Angeles floods shows how at a critical moment city authorities rejected the idea of zoning to avoid floods.
The ecosystem in the world that most resembles Los Angeles' is the Mediterranean, he tells us--and the best natural history of the ancient Mediterranean is found in the Bible.
World War II was over, Europe wanted to scrub off its history, and Berio and Penderecki, an Italian and a Pole, were two of the music world's most ruthless and effective slate-cleaners.
Berio, on the other hand, hasn't needed to rediscover history.
The pierced generation may simply be acknowledging the deadliness of the times we live in, suggestive as they are of earlier epochs in human history.
Many intense, solitary, and impassioned heroines of fiction and history, wearing black dresses in illustrative art, helped set the tone for hosts of modern temptresses in black.
Given the accumulated cultural force of its myriad uses in history, you might predict that the future of black clothing would be at least as long as its past.
Hair in historical movies is often the same, never mind the elaborately coiled and oiled evidence of history.
Ever since priests, scholars, and poets used writing to record Scripture, prayer law, and history both exalted and prosaic, reverence for canonical writings has lent an august power to written words themselves.
Popular fashion history claims that the Modern Woman was created when women gave up corsets.
During the 600 years when fashion developed its own history, both skirts and hair were considered immutable, even when fashion went to extremes.
He invented sfumato, inaugurated the High Renaissance, and created what is arguably the cleverest composition in the history of art, The Last Supper .
The casual visitor to the current exhibition of the Codex Leicester at the American Museum of Natural History in New York (through Jan.
But I am struck most by a commentary that appeared in the Mexican weekly Etcétera , under the byline Gilberto Guevara Niebla--no relation to Che himself, yet a figure of great importance in the revolutionary history of the 1960s.
Or last Sunday's New York Times Book Review , which concluded, "What is left is simply the man--a rebel who could not part with his dream, and who earned a place in history precisely because he refused to yield to it."
The films also build upon the long history of popular American support for Irish independence.
In fact, the big bang is probably the only idea in the history of science that was ever resisted because of its pro-God import.
"So long as the universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a creator," Hawking wrote in A Brief History of Time . "But if the universe is completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning or end: it would simply be.

Note 10: Among other things, they warn against the danger of removing the Holocaust from history and turning it into a sort of secular religion, the central symbol of Jewish identity.
This particular brand of sexual doublespeak has been remarked upon before, most famously by the late French historian Michel Foucault, who, in his History of Sexuality (published in English in 1978), put forth his unexpected "repressive hypothesis": Those supposedly tight-lipped Victorians, in the course of devising rules to regulate sex and the sciences that investigate its perversions, in fact talked and wrote more about sex than anyone before them.
It's understandable why this fantasy of flight would take root in black America, which, at numerous moments in its history, has been given reason to fear that conditions in the diaspora can never be improved.
This work was Parkes' magisterial Pause and Effect: An Introduction to the History of Punctuation in the West , a book that at last stripped the cloak of anonymity from the important work of commas, periods, dashes, colons, semicolons, and countless other full- and part-time functionaries.
This fall another noteworthy volume on the apparatus of written language has been published-- The Footnote: A Curious History , by the Princeton University historian Anthony Grafton.
(For examples, see the effective but very different techniques employed by Nicholson Baker in his novel The Mezzanine , and by David Foster Wallace in the novel Infinite Jest and in the essays collected in A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again .) On the other hand, the footnote as scholarly reference tool or scholarly reference weapon has never enjoyed more prominence than it does today--"each serious work of history," Grafton notes, "must now travel on an impregnably armored bottom, rather like a tank."
Ranke, with his avowed intention to show history wie es eigentlich gewesen --how it really was--and with his ambition to put the study of history on a scientific footing, doubtless had a more pervasive influence on the formal output of generations of historians.

In fact, The Fifth Element , at a reported cost of 90 million (dollars, not francs), is the most expensive French-financed film in history.
She seems to have confused James' irony with distance--when, in truth, few authors in history have achieved such pitiless and devastating intimacy.
I recount Beatty's history in this gossipy way to suggest why his latest movie, Bulworth , has been praised as such a radical departure for its star-director and why, in some ways, it is.
If La Cenerentola --Rossini's version of the Cinderella story--has made it to the Met for the first time in the company's history, it is only because Bartoli brought it there.

When Williams addresses the child as his noble patron ("my Lord") and alludes to the old myth of the tortoise that supports the universe, he slyly introduces the underlying weight of civilization and history into the interchange between him and the child.
On my way out of town, I drive through a fold in time,a tunnel through the history of shopping:boarded-up storefronts on the narrow commercial streets,the old strips and plazas with a muffler shop or a chicken fryer left,and larger sites--a five-and-dime blown out into a warehouse,fast-food shops, all local chains now,with their scratchy speakers and pot-holed drive-thru lanes;then the first real malls, big as aircraft carriers, low and blocky,their outlying coffee shops and two-screen theaters like escorts;at last a quieting stretch, the freeway growing wallsand the walled tracts all around nestled in their names--The Willows, Hunt Club Crossing, Hidden Acres--their malls planted, soft-colored, smoothly designed,broad single lumps surrounded by asphalt prairie,distant and unobtrusive as buttes.
Franklin does have a history of confessing to crimes all over the country.
The closing statement says that one of the central characters, Archie, Wallace's black servant, "was created to reflect a viewpoint concerning this turbulent period of American history."
Though rooted in history, its portrayal of Johnson fits into the great Hollywood tradition of dramatic enhancement.
Though he may have been overlooked in white newspapers of the time and in subsequent histories of the era, Johnson was certainly notorious.
He trained more fanatically than anyone in the history of martial arts, mastering grappling, boxing, karate, kickboxing, footfighting, and other styles.
But to trace the lineage of Raising the Roof, one must understand the history of the sports gesture itself.
The Mavericks, in Music for All Occasions (MCA), clearly possess enough knowledge of country's history to feel ambivalent toward it; but it's such a high-functioning bar band that it can't be alternative.
In other shots, Indians with raised tomahawks and spears give rise to a nervous wall panel at the ICP assuring us that Levinthal is "mindful of real history," and that his work somehow "prompts the viewer's recollections of our forefathers' injustices: cultural expansionism, genocide and racism."
Far from being a documentarian, Brady considered himself an artist, and his images, in the jargon of current art history, were highly "constructed."
We may also know something about how history was rewritten wholesale in the Soviet Union during those years--how the facts concerning the October Revolution were successively recast as key figures fell from favor, how the existence of Leon Trotsky was first reviled and then denied after he was forced into exile in 1927, how even such things as the invention of electric light were reattributed to Russians in the textbooks (an astonishing number of scientific breakthroughs were allegedly the work of one Popov).
The second is a version printed in a 1940 History of the USSR , looking less like a photograph than like an awkward charcoal tracing; the comrade on the left has been excised, having in fact been imprisoned prior to being shot.
In his opening remarks for Eyes of the Nation: A Visual History of the United States , Librarian of Congress James H. Billington strikes a fondly nationalistic note: "What makes the American narrative unique is the ability we have displayed time and again to remedy our mistakes, to adjust to changing circumstances, to debate and then move on in directions that seem better for all."
Though it resembles a standard high-school history text, with chapters on the Civil War, immigration, imperial expansion, and so on, Eyes of the Nation is a book one flips through, not a book one views and reads in sequence.
Brinkley, a highly class-conscious historian, is better at robber barons, depressions, strikes, and grass-roots politics than at wars and natural history.
And though hindsight sometimes breeds determinism, Brinkley is alert to alternative histories and paths just barely not taken.
The book concludes in orthodox multiculturalism and a surprisingly bitter estimate of America's democratic potential: "America approached the century's end as fractured along social, racial, ethnic, economic, gender, and regional lines as it had been in all but a few moments in its history; with a culture so diverse and so contentious that it seemed to lack any coherence or shape; with declining faith in its government, its leaders, and its principal institutions."
Paul Strand (1890-1976) enjoyed a long and prolific career spanning what amounts to five or six generations in the compressed history of 20 th century photography.
Starting in August, a $300 million advertising campaign will show jet pilots breaking the sound barrier--and then being magically transported to their bathrooms, where they'll enjoy the quickest, slickest shave in history.
He's won more money on the PGA Tour than anyone else in history, yet he will go down in history as a man of extraordinary misfortune--not so much a failure as a fatality, a victim of golf's surgical ability to bring to the surface a man's mental weakness.

The British Open has a longer history and the Masters is more familiar--it's played on the same course every year, and some of us can recite the yardage from tee to green on the back nine--but the U.S.
So far as I can tell, the trend was set in motion a decade or so ago when Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington published her sexual history of Picasso.
There is history here, of all sorts: Kelly Harrell impersonating Charles Guiteau, President Garfield's assassin; the Carolina Tar Heels voicing the lament of shoemakers made redundant by the Industrial Revolution; Charlie Poole singing, "Roosevelt in the White House, he's doing his best; McKinley in the graveyard, he's taking his rest."

The shock was so great she found herself downing too much white wine (this was at lunch) as an antiseptic, since Prudie did not know the gentleman nearly well enough to be familiar with his health history.

Many people refuse to accept James Earl Ray's guilt (or Lee Harvey Oswald's in JFK's assassination) because they can't accept that one insignificant lowlife could topple a hero and alter history.
With their grand designs in which everything has its place, conspiracists seek to impose a reassuring order on the randomness of history.

Why History Is on Clinton's Side in the Impeachment Fight
This leaves history as our only guide.
In this situation, Johnson's impeachment looms as the operative precedent: a case of men who despised and battled their president--perhaps with good reason--but whose zeal in pursuing flimsy impeachment charges turned the judgment of history against them.
To understand why Orwell did what he did, it's necessary to reconstruct a bit of history.
Nearly 4,000 people a day are paying an obscene $12 per head to see the shimmering machines, making it by far the best-attended show in the Guggenheim's history.
But in doing so, he more or less eviscerates his own claim that these machines belong in a modern art museum, as opposed to one focused on design, transportation, or history.
But even in Italy, Germany, and Britain, countries with long histories of public subsidy for culture, government support has recently drawn public fire.
Nathan Myhrvold needs to reread his scientific history ("Mars to Humanity: Get Over Yourself").
Jodie T. Allen's article titled "The Biggest Tax Increase in History" repeats, without challenging, Susan Molinari's claim that government takes in 40 percent of the GDP in taxes.
I mention this history, rather than dueling with Sedlak and Broadhurst's statistics, because I think that it exemplifies their selective presentation of information.
This was supposed to guarantee Republican presidential supremacy forever--or at least until the name "Ronald Reagan" had slipped into the wells of history.
It is also clear that the motivation behind such legislation is a reaction to "multiculturalism" and the history of European brutality toward non-Christian, non-European peoples.
I object, however, to Foer's characterization of both the famine and the current vogue of Irish-American identification with Irish history and culture.
Unfortunately, Foer's apparent ignorance of Irish history goes deeper still.
The historic policies of the English crown, and later, the British government, turned a crop failure into one of modern history's most tragic episodes.
If Irish-Americans tend to have a superficial understanding of their own history, and to focus on the positive aspects of their culture to the exclusion of less admirable parts, this only proves that they are human, and as prone to historical myopia as Anglophiles or Afrocentrists.
She characterizes Chambers as a Dostoyevskian figure, "trying to break what he saw as the 'invincible ignorance' of a nation blinded to the 'crisis of history' by its prosperity and misguided generous-mindedness."
In addition, what Landsburg didn't say is that no society in human history has ever sustained very rapid economic growth for 100 years.
In addition to his simplistic model and the sheer arrogance of his prose, Landsburg spews anti-conservationist nonsense that demonstrates a total ignorance of history.
I'd bet that each famine-wracked region in history had at least one person like Landsburg who had been predicting 2 percent economic growth for centuries and ridiculing anyone who tried to consider the consequences of their actions.
I enjoyed the Committee of Correspondence discussion "Cycles, Waves, and Endings in History," and I agree with those who say that the generational conflict is driving electoral politics and policy-making.
"Bra Story," by Anne Hollander, was a great contribution to the recent surge in chronicling the history of the unleashing of the female form in the 20 th century.

And finally, the idea that the editors could have spared her the injury of having to read Stein's piece had they listed it under the title of "Diary" takes the prize for "most ludicrous statement thus far expressed in the history of Slate's publication."
To blur those distinctions is to distort history far more than a mildly conservative magazine, or a lukewarm "conservative" party, is likely to do.
Diggins forgets, in his discompassionate and deluded rewriting of history, that Lincoln was no NAACP poster boy himself.
He defended Israel when it was in the greatest danger of its history, in 1973, and the Israelis regarded him as their friend.
In "A Brief History of Taxes," the chart she runs with her diatribe against supply-side economics is worthless, as even Paul Krugman would advise, because it accounts for neither the efficiency of the market in discounting changes in tax law throughout the legislative process, nor the volatility of monetary policy during the last 30 years of a floating dollar.
Jodie T. Allen's "A Brief History of Taxes" was indeed brief, though perhaps appropriately so, given the very narrow focus of her argument.
You will go down in history as one of the first and best attempts to use the Internet to spread intellectual debate and well-written articles on politics and culture.
The history of the 20 th century certainly justifies this fear, but the fact that even Liu accepts Abrams' false premise shows how confused many are on this subject.

His two most Borgesian works are The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis (1984), an hommage to the great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, and The History of the Siege of Lisbon (1989), in which a proofreader inserts a single word--"not"--into a single sentence in a book he's checking, thereby questioning every celebrated theme of Portuguese history.

To professor of history Sean Wilentz, writing in Dissent , the best Dylan song of the 1980s was the unreleased (until 1991) "Blind Willie McTell."
Critics are legitimately fascinated with this concert, which occurred at a crucial moment both in Dylan's career and in American cultural history.
"History is offering Sharon a one-time-only chance to record to his credit the political step so needed by his country," it said.
In his new book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life , Michael Schudson divides American history into three periods, each governed by a different notion of civic participation.

The editor of The New Yorker takes on one of the most written-about sports figures in American history and "succeeds, more than any previous book, in bringing Ali into focus" (Allen Barra, the Wall Street Journal ). Critics lavish praise on Remnick, not just for his analysis of Ali but because he is said to have brilliantly invoked the complex intersection of boxing and race relations in the 1960s.
He'd better brush up on history as well as geography.
Chuck Schumer is either 1) the "dirtiest" or 2) the "ugliest" campaign in New York's history.
Greenberg liked Pollock because of the evidence he provided for Greenberg's Marxian view of art history as a series of developing stages in which the picture plane was destined to flatten, empty, and disappear.
It's certainly unexplored in American History X , in which Edward Norton plays a racist, homicidal skinhead who's never more mythically transfixing than in the seconds before he stomps on the neck of a prone African-American car thief.
Some of American History X is sharp, red-meat melodrama, with sensational acting and scenes of violence at once thrillingly kinetic and revolting.
American History X reaches a pinnacle of ghastliness when Cameron sends Derek and his fellow skinheads into a Korean-purchased supermarket, the new owner of which has allegedly replaced "real Americans" with cheap, illegal immigrant labor.
I don't know what he originally had in mind--or whose idea the garish, inconclusive ending was--but American History X isn't that bad.
Here the context is the history of the New York Police and Fire departments, organizations traditionally short on anti-racist parodists, and the commissioners of both bodies gave these guys the boot.

H astert may be Exhibit 1. "Coach," as he's fondly known, has a history of modest service to his party and his district, delivering pork, opposing Democratic health-care bills, etc.
Hastert won't cripple the party with a too-big mouth and too-big ideas, as Newt Gingrich did, and he won't cripple it with an embarrassing history, as Livingston did.
Reagan and Clinton both are among the great bullshitters of American history, but somehow Reagan was always regarded as floating above the truth while Clinton is regarded as wallowing beneath it.

The most acclaimed and second highest grossing film of 1998 (just behind Armageddon ) was Saving Private Ryan .

In fact, each of these assertions is subject to qualification, as is made clear in Noel Malcolm's masterly (but misnamed) Kosovo: A Short History (my main source along with Hugh Poulton's The Balkans: Minorities and States in Conflict ). The tie of today's Albanian Kosovars to the ancient Illyrians is fairly attenuated.
That, in a nutshell, is the history of Kosovo.

Our actions in the weeks ahead will decide history.

Professor of history
After the first half-hour, in which the students interview Burkittsville residents about the history of the Blair Witch (one Elly Kedward, found guilty of sorcery in 1785 and lashed to a tree during a harsh winter), the remainder of the movie is their increasingly desperate odyssey through the woods.
Brinkley's worthy democratic instincts inspire him to use entertainment to teach history.
Brinkley (who is not David Brinkley's son--that's Columbia history prof Alan Brinkley) stands at the intersection of academia, serious journalism, and TV punditry.
Brinkley abhors the narrow academic history that has dominated universities.
He scorns scholarly monographs and favors a democratic, populist history.
As history grew more and more abstruse in the '60s and '70s, historians ceded the role of public intellectual to journalists.
Brinkley first came to prominence as America's leading neo-beatnik, a believer that the best way to learn history is on the road.
In 1992, he led 17 students from Hofstra University (where he then taught) on a six-week history road trip, from the Grand Canyon to Route 66, from Ken Kesey's farm to Jack London's ranch.
The Majic Bus illustrates both the charms and flaws of Brinkley's notion of public history.
Brinkley is a cheerleader for American history.
Blessed with preternatural gregariousness, good humor, and a love of attention, he's been tireless about pursuing both celebrity and the cause of popular history ever since.
He will happily decorate any TV or radio story with a veneer of American history.
At the same time, he has managed to write or co-write eight books in the past seven years, including three full-scale biographies and a lively 600-page history of the United States.
Brinkley's sunniness and ardor are appealing, but his public history has its shortcomings.
His books read like good journalism--and that's no insult--but they are not great history.

The brittle, shallow, single, gold-digging, thirtysomething protagonist of Janowitz's latest hate letter to Manhattan is pronounced so unpleasant as to make the entire novel (which follows her search for a suitably rich and connected husband) quite a drag: "A hateful heroine and a catalog of conspicuous consuming do not an amusing read make" (Elizabeth Gleick, Time ). "One of the least likable characters in modern fiction history.
Critics praise the Long Island duo's latest offering as "their best album since 1990's Business As Usual " (Rob Hart, CMJ ).

I must thank David Greenberg for the fascinating "History Lesson" ("") on the postwar Jewish "Revenge Group," but I disagree that such an organized and, frankly, insane plan has much in common with the revenge killings by Albanians (we assume) of Serbs in present-day Kosovo.

"Thanks to Gielgud and fellow Brits, museum-goers 'from ages 5 to 105' won't be able to attend the 'Hands on History: The British Aristocracy' exhibit, which encouraged attendees to examine life-sized models of past sovereigns and then hypothesize which members of the royal family might have been syphilitic."

4. What kind of moment are we at in American history?
This would-be thriller gets punctured by the critics: "Possibly the funniest movie ever made about Catholicism--from a theological point of view" (Ebert, the Chicago Sun-Times ).

9. Pat Buchanan: The scary thing, he undoubtedly knows the history of that slogan and that movement.
The shop owner recognized its significance after he cleaned it and turned it over to scientists at the nearby American Museum of Natural History.
The most controversial academic book of the season is The Ecological Indian: Myth and History , by Brown anthropology professor Shepard Krech III.
Buchanan may be a compelling writer, but critics attack his isolationist policies and revisionist history (highlight: Germany would not have invaded France had America stayed out of World War II).
It said, "A speech of this type, had it been made, could have been a direct and frank appeal to those Germans who wish to confront their past and to Israelis who wish to preserve it in the annals of human history."
So World War II is avoided, millions of lives--you know, the right sort of lives--are saved, and history is transformed in ways so utopian, you'd never recognize the present.
The Americans' one-point victory over the European team was the biggest comeback in the tournament's history.
A little while later, the "RCA Building" sign that had been on 30 Rock since its construction was replaced with one reading "GE Building," completing the eradication of the individual employee and the rewriting of architectural history.

In his response to Bush's complaint Exley rehearses the history of Bush's antagonism toward his site, citing W.'s infamous statement that "there ought to be limits to freedom."
Pat's Personal History
The real news about A Republic, Not an Empire is that it repeatedly warps American history to support Buchanan's nativist ideology.
For Buchanan, what others call isolationism has a noble history, dating to George Washington's admonition that America should "steer clear of permanent alliances."
But even those who don't should realize that Buchanan's method--forming his conclusions based on prejudice, then rustling up the support for them--invariably produces bad history.

But onscreen, when Pitt announces to the assembled fighters that they are the "middle children of history" with "no purpose and no place"--emasculated on one hand by the lack of a unifying crisis (a world war or depression) and on the other by lack of material wealth as promised by television--he seems meant to be intoning gospel.

Still, in the vast sweep of history, a 50 to 60 percent approval rating isn't particularly great--it's about where President Kennedy's lowest job-approval rating sat.
And it is only with a great effort of will that I now refrain from referring you to my new favorite publication, Beer Frame: The Journal of Inconspicuous Consumption , and its article on the superiority of the Hydrox to the Oreo, its salute to products with "edible spokescharacters" like the Pillsbury Doughboy, Charlie the Tuna, and Slim Jim, and finally its definitive history of the styptic pencil ("styptic," proclaims the editors, "is such an excellent word").

Such history brings strengths: Since Cook's first allegiance is to feminism (more specifically, to gay rights), she is not dug in on most of the political and economic questions that divide FDR's hagiographers from his detractors.
It also brings weaknesses: This is radical history, and Cook's description of post-World War I race riots, of the Wobblies' agitation in the 1920s, of mid-1930s anti-communism (which she calls a "Red Scare"), could have been written by Earl Browder.

The Women's History of the Word
For the most part, the book consists of a rewriting of history, from the dawn of time, with the purpose of demonstrating two main themes: the “fact” that women were responsible for all the important contributions to the advancement of civilization (as the development of agriculture, for instance), often despite the arrogance and stupidity of men; and the “fact” that women have long been subjected to domination by men.

Coulmas's clear exposition of the history of writing systems traces the development of various kinds of writing systems--ideographic, pictographic, morphemic, syllabic, phonemic, and phonetic--through history, discussing them individually, describing how certain ancient scripts were deciphered, and presenting his cogent arguments for regarding at least some aspects of language through the analysis of writing.

Elaborate taxonomies and obscure explanations such as mispronunciation due to ignorance, malapropisms based on both ignorance and misunderstanding, and, for the dictated word, the technological dyslexia of typographical errors and poor grasp of the diction of the dictators of medical histories may be suggested.

How it came about the the myth could take the place of history, and feed both fiction and utopia, that fiction in the form of dogma of various kinds could take the place of science, that science could progressively dominate fiction, that history, in eliminating myth, could itself become a science, at the cost of a ruthless battle between the imaginary and the real--a battle whose outcome, even today, remains unclear--this story reads like a novel: and in any case, doesn't the word history itself, which designates a succession of facts through time, also encapsulate the word story: a tale, a fable, an imaginary account?

This is made clear to me every time someone discovers that I am a “word man”--that I am an editor on the Dictionary of American Regional English and write a column about word histories in the Atlantic . Inevitably, I am presented with a favourite lexical curiosity and asked where it came from.
This reveals two assumptions: that I am a walking dictionary and that the word's history will of course be known.
The first involves words whose histories lend themselves to philological principles or “rules” of linguistic change.
The histories of these words are generally more recent, rarely reaching back to to proto-language, and are anomalous in some way, deriving, for example, from a historical incident or the name of a person.

Location is more difficult, because its sense history in American English is complex; but in the Australian usage of the 1788-1838 period it meant either `an allocation or grant of land' or `the act of establishing a settler in a place,' in which case it was synonymous with settlement, as in the country will shortly be thrown open to general location.

Until 1974, Shetland was officially known as Zetland, a name more suggestive of its fascinating and ancient history.
A new awareness of rich history and tradition of belonging to “The Old Rock” plus caution concerning any threat to the native environment now provide much food for thought and material for pungent new Shetland proverbs.
To put it broadly, we must be guided by language as well as by history or geography.
The occasional historical comment involving history recent enough for me to have been a part of it is not always exactly right.
In fine, while there is no doubt that the Companion will--and should--become a standard work on the language, one must not impute to its function anything more than its service as a guide: the English language is unimaginably vast, in its origins and history, in its literary, philosophical, psychological, social, and specialized applications, and in the descriptions of its grammar, usage, dialects, and lexicon, both historical and contemporary.
What happens when the American Museum of Natural History wants to talk to entomologists in Europe about a butterfly we call the mourning cloak?

A History of the English Language,
Baugh's book was the primer, the basic grammar on the history of English.
The first edition of Baugh's History was published in 1935; because so much has happened to English since then, it is fitting that its history be updated, not only to reflect more recent developments in dialect, lexicon, grammatical theory, and the universal adoption of the language as a lingua franca, but also to revise scholarship in the light of later research that either elaborates or confutes information that is now more than half a century old.

Arnold Toynbee, distinguished philosopher of history, in his old age wrote about his having learned “about the difference between the American language and my native Unitedkingdomese.”
History never stands still; and this had reduced my Unitedkingdomese dialect to the status of being a bizarre provincial “brogue.”
But in a chapter entitled—make that titled— “Americanisms,” the manual betrays both an unseemly nationalistic bias and an ignorance of the history of its own language.
Maybe not, but any Rhode Islander aware of his state's predacious history would get the idea.
I write about natural history for a living.

Street is from the Latin via strata , a paved road, a phrase whose own history mirrors the relation of ride and road: via `road' is cognate not only with our way , but with a whole set of Latinate words suggesting movement: vehement, convey , and even vehicle itself; just as way is related to wag and wagon .
Car , the plainest of our motor-vehicle words, has a complicated history.

This is the case with a favorite Australian term for an Englishman, pom or pommy . At first sight this might appear to be a British regional dialect word, but there is no possible etymon even remotely like it recorded in Wright or the OED . So, whereas for dinkum , for instance, a sense history can be established that fits chronologically with a verifiable regional antecedent, for pommy there is no such answer.
Already after 30 years LPs, gramophones , and wirelesses belong to history and a never-ending tide of new transatlantic terminology swamps these shores with the everyday expressions of Chicago and Silicon Valley.
For some people, a comprehensive description of the history of words in English is more information than they wish to assimilate, and they will be relieved to learn that Schleifer covers the territory in about ten pages.
We know the cat was domesticated both in the East and West in the early historical period, the ancient Egyptians being credited with having been the first people to have done so and at one period in their history to have worshiped it as sacred.
That acknowledgment having been made, I find myself continually irritated by their cavalier dismissal of everything that human beings developed in the course of history: it reflects an adolescent mentality that is scornful of anything that might have taken place before these parvenu geniuses put finger to keyboard.
Hearing the vernacular spoken on the modern streets of Sofia is like hearing a cross-section of this Slavic nation's tumultuous history.
However, just because elements in the same area of the Table are related atomically and chemically, this neatness is not necessarily reflected in the names, let alone the two-character symbols we have given to elements, which reflect all the chaos, variety, whims, and even vanity of history and human nature.
After a brief history of the alphabet, each of the twenty-six succeeding chapters is devoted to a single letter, with a final one discussing signs and symbols.
Extrapolating on the theories of the Renaissance designer, Geofroy Tory, as expounded in his Champ Fleury (1529), Firmage takes Tory's sketches as the springboard for his analysis of the letter-shapes and the sometimes highly stylized forms they assume throughout history, from their inchoate inception in the Near East down to present-day, computer-generated typefaces.

Quantifying the role of climatic variation in the dynamics at multiple trophic levels requires, however, a modeling framework that first accounts for the influence of interspecific and intrinsic processes on the dynamical structure at each level, so that the influence of intrinsic processes on the autoregressive (AR) structure of the time series data is not mistaken for a lagged influence of environmental stochasticity [ 11 ] .
, [ 19 21 22 23 ] , we are unaware of studies showing an influence of winter climate on wolf population dynamics.

Hanks and Hodges totally ignore such American influence, though the evidence for it is overwhelming.
Moreover, and as this volume indicates, the offsetting influences of lean retailing and short-cycle production in comparison with low foreign labor rates must be evaluated by product demand variability, rather than simply making generalizations about aggregate trade and immigration.

Looking back, individuals who make these choices under social influence are often grateful for the external inducement to do the right thing.
Garry Wills makes much of the Greek influence in shaping Lincoln’s style at Gettysburg.
6 But of the biblical influence on the Gettysburg Address, Wills has almost nothing to say.
My sense of the literature of American history is that our scholars not only ignore the biblical influences on Lincoln’s thinking at Gettysburg but also fail to understand the significance of the “nation” that “our fathers brought forth on this continent.”
They meant to set up a standard maxim for a free society, which should be familiar to all, and revered by all, constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence.

Previous data showed that although Zn(II) binding is not absolutely required for formation of the cleaved complex, it increased the amount of cleaved complex that can be isolated [ 31 ] . When linked to Top67, the ZD domain also has some influence on the cleavage site selections.
However, in light of our recent findings implicating this loop region of p51 as a critical structural element supporting the catalytic functions of p66, it seems feasible that mutation at position 138 in p51 effectively altered the binding of TSAO through its influence on the p66 catalytic subunit [ 14 ] .
However, there was good uniformity among arrays in terms of scaling factors and percentages of probe sets with P detection < 0.1, and both age groups were comprised of 2 pools and 4 individual samples, which should minimize the influence of using both pooled and individual samples (see Additional file 1).

Specification of a particular cellular identity might depend entirely upon the influence of instructive signals that change with time.
The conditions required to induce the production of sexual males and females has been established [ 8 9 ] . There has also been work on the influence of genetic background and the environment on the duration of egg development in different species and strains [ 10 11 ] . The most comprehensive study of aphid egg development, by Behrandt [ 12 ] , suggests that it constitutes three stages: (i) a temperature dependent period of initial development, (ii) a temperature independent 'diapause' followed by (iii) temperature dependent development.
Diapause typically involves as a period of developmental arrest during which an insect is resistant to environmental influences on developmental progression [ 2 ] . Sexually-produced A. pisum embryos do not demonstrate developmental arrest.
A. pisum embryos do, however, show resistance to environmental influences on developmental progression.
Further research is therefore necessary to determine the influence of fluctuating temperatures on developmental progression, both with respect to developmental abnormalities and developmental rate.
To determine the influence of temperature on the progression of development we stored the eggs under three temperature regimes, all with the same 13L:11D photoperiod: (1) 4°C in the light and 0°C in the dark; (2) constant 10°C; (3) constant 16°C.
This was done by the method of Henikoff & Henikoff [ 19 ] , as previously described [ 20 ] . In summary, the first step was to weight each sequence in a multiple sequence alignment block according to its degree of similarity to the other sequences, which has the effect of minimizing the influence of highly redundant sequences in the final profile.
This two-step procedure was found to reduce the influence of bin size on mode estimation.
However, these same data indicate that less than 6% of the variance in evolutionary rates is explained by the variance in the number of protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the influence of the number of interacting partners on protein evolutionary rates might not be substantial.
012) fit to the data by least squares regression as well as the small r 2value (r 2= 0.0065) suggest that the influence of the number of interacting partners on rates of evolution is minor at best.
A multivariate analysis was performed to examine the influence of this polymorphism and other covariates (Table 3).
In contrast, the marginal difference reflected a very modest influence on insulin sensitivity of the A54T polymorphism in the Pima Indian population, which is consistent with our observation that this polymorphism only accounted for 7.3% of the variation in %S in this Caucasian population.
Furthermore, since 1) insulin resistance is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of T2DM, 2) this polymorphism has only a very modest influence on insulin sensitivity, and 3) beta cell dysfunction, on which this polymorphism has no influence in the present study, plays a key role in the development of overt diabetes [ 2], the population association studies and linkage studies are not able to detect the interaction between this polymorphism and the diabetes phenotype.

We found that this polymorphism had an independent, but very modest influence (7.
Backward stepwise option with alpha-to-enter of 0.10 and alpha-to-remove of 0.10 was employed to exclude covariates that had much less or no influence on the parameter under analysis, one at a time starting from the one had least impact, which was based on the p value (the highest p value).
SCF Slmbappears to influence other cell cycle events, perhaps by actions on other substrates, or perhaps as a result of events that are secondary to its influence on E2F destruction.
Limitations of the mathematical model, uncertainties in the thermodynamic parameters and influences of the secondary structure in vivo by specific interactions of RNA-protein complexes limit the prediction capacities of secondary structure by these programs.
Since the influence of non-specific binding is more severe for probes where no or little specific hybridization occurs [ 8 ] , we treat the problem as one of detecting a threshold value that is both determined by the highest signals attributable to spots representing non-specific hybridization and the lowest signals from spots where sequence specific hybridization must be assumed.
A relatively large target was used to accommodate ligands with a range of potential sizes and also to minimize the influence of flanking primer sequences.

Different positions of the leg between the electrodes were tested with no influence on the toxicity.
The influence of the type of electrodes-needle or calliper - was not tested in our experiments.
established that the toxicity of electroporation was correlated with the degree of cell permeabilisation [ 17 ] and that these was similar when using needles or calliper [ 18 ] . Thus, it may be assumed that the electrode type is not of crucial influence on the toxicity induced by the electroporation.
Values for attention network efficiency were calculated from the raw reaction time data as previously described [ 31 ] . Medians were calculated for each test conditions (12 conditions in total: 4 cue levels by 3 target levels, combined target locations and target directions) to avoid the influence of the outliers.
In learning and memory tasks, which require the use of visual spatial cues, males acquire and exhibit superior performance to females [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ] . This sex difference in rats has been attributed to the hormonal influence of estrogen (presumably by way of its in situ conversion from testosterone by the aromatase enzyme in brain) [ 19 20 21 22 ] , and is observable morphologically in visually spatial critical brain areas (i.e.
The available research regarding cognitive function and phytoestrogens suggests that large amounts of phytoestrogens, consumed as tofu, have an adverse influence on cognitive ability in men, where decreased brain weight, increased ventricular size and dementia have been reported [ 44 ] . In ovariectomized female rats, on the other hand, phytoestrogen treatments resulted in a dose-dependent improvement of VSM [ 45 ] . This improvement in cognitive ability in phytoestrogen treated females may be due in part to the increased presence of choline acetyltransferase messenger RNA in the frontal cortex, which has been shown to be associated with protection and enhancement of cognitive function [ 45 ] . Furthermore, we have shown that phytoestrogens significantly affect the brain calcium-binding protein calbindin (CALB), which acts as a buffer by binding intracellular calcium and plays an important role in mediating cell proliferation, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and neurotoxicity [ 48 49 50 51 52 ] . This neuroprotective mechanism via CALB appears to be important in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease [ 48 49 50 51 52 ] . Additionally, Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) seems to play an important role in mediating functional neuronal maturation and responses to certain stimuli in the brain [ 53 54 55 ] . The expression of COX-2 is associated with key pathophysiologic events in Alzheimer's disease: deposition of beta-amyloid protein in neuritic plaques within the hippocampus and cortex [ 53 54 55 ] . Of particular importance to this study is the fact that COX-2 has been shown to be influenced by steroidal hormones [ 53 54 55 ] . Therefore, the expression of COX-2 in the frontal cortex may also be hormonally regulated and relevant to cognitive decline.
The design of this study was to examine the influence of phytoestrogens (present via soy in rodent diets) on VSM in three separate experiments utilizing radial arm maze methods to examine varying aspects of memory.
The present study addressed these issues, in part, by investigating the influence of dietary phytoestrogens (present in a normal rodent diet), on visual spatial ability.
Measures of accuracy on the baited/unbaited four-arm task (experiment 3) demonstrated that a diet change in young adult animals (a change from Phyto-600 to Phyto-free) had a positive influence on the accuracy in males, but a negative influence on the accuracy in females.
Measures of accuracy on the baited/unbaited four-arm task (experiment 3) demonstrated that a diet change in young adult animals (a change from Phyto-600 to Phyto-free) had a positive influence on the accuracy in males, but a negative influence on the accuracy in females.
In a companion paper, the impact of hormonal manipulation and dietary phytoestrogens' influence on VSM is examined and validates several aspects of the findings from the present study.
In this regard, it is known that the hormonal action of estrogens may be mediated by the differential expression of estrogen receptors alpha vs betta in brain structures that activate or inhibit cell death mechanisms [ 56 ] . Although, this parameter was not directly investigated in this study, the differing influence that dietary phytoestrogens had on CALB (significant decrease) and COX-2 (significant increase) in the male frontal cortex, suggests that phytoestrogens may activate programmed cell death.
Dietary phytoestrogens sex reversed VSM, as expressed in the radial-arm maze by enhancing spatial memory in females but inhibited this ability in males, this finding corresponds to research regarding increased dementia observed in aged men consuming high tofu levels [ 44 ] . However, while it is important to establish the influence of dietary phytoestrogens on brain function and behavior in animal models, the true significance in humans remains to be determined as it relates to the present findings.
However, brain aromatase and circulating plasma estradiol levels in male rats does not appear to be influenced by dietary phytoestrogens [ 22 41 51 ] . As the results from this research imply, phytoestrogens have considerable effects on hormonally sensitive parameters and their influence may be, in part, responsible for many reported sexual dimorphisms such as, the establishment and plasticity of sexually dimorphic brain structures like the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) and the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) [ 40 41 ] .
This study, examined the influence of phytoestrogens, present in rodent diets, on VSM and identified phytoestrogens, CALB, and COX-2 expression in the rat brain.
Residuals for these traits were computed for both traits to minimize the influence of brain weight.
However, for white matter to have an orienting influence, there must also be a relatively non-permissive substrate that restricts growing axons to a parallel course.
These data suggest that the orienting influence of white matter geometry on neurite outgrowth involves myelin and, possibly, its associated neurite-growth inhibitory activity.
8d) gives a view of the data without influence by long period trends in the data set.
Drugs like clonidine and guanfacine act to block norepinepherine, and reduce or eliminate the normal effect of warning signals on reaction time, but have no influence on orienting to the target location [ 29 ] .
The C/T SNP at -521 showed an additive influence on executive attention as shown in Figure 1Bwhere the mean executive attention scores of the C/C and T/T genotypic classes showed a nominally significant difference (P = 0.06).
As shown in Figure 3A, the MAO-LPR showed a significant influence on alerting (P < 0.01) and on executive attention (P < 0.05) as seen in Figure 3B.
Medians were calculated for each test conditions (4 cue levels by 3 target levels, 12 conditions in total) to avoid the influence of the outliers.
LD cycles can influence the expression of sleep by entraining the circadian pacemaker that drives the diurnal rhythm of sleep and/or by directly affecting the expression of sleep, thereby 'masking' the influence of the pacemaker on sleep.
A previous study has reported that the presence of capsaicin and chemical cross-linkers influence the formation of multimers in VR1 [ 23 ] . Moreover, this study reported that cross-linking could be a Ca 2+mediated process, through the activation of endogenous transglutaminases.
Parasympathetic impulses are the main excitatory influence and contract the bladder causing emptying.
Qualitative comparable central projections are found in wildtype control littermates (data not shown) and suggest that the central projection to cochlear nuclei is at least until P8 in mice not critically dependent on auditory information or other hair cell-mediated influences, in agreement with recent suggestions [ 5 19 ] .
However, olanzapine and risperidone may also result in urinary disturbances by their influence on central pathways mediating bladder contractions or coordinating external urethral sphincter, as may have been the case in the present study.
Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that all four of these serines are phosphorylated by GRK, and all four are needed for desensitization [ 12 ] . The influence of this motif on down-regulation was not investigated, however.

The most effective educational programs are structured to include a social influence intervention [ 6 14 ] . Moreover, associations between cigarette smoking and social norms, peer influences and perceived tobacco use prevalence have been reported among a group of middle school students (6 th-8 thgrades) [ 15 ] . The social influences model includes dimensions reflecting both normative beliefs (e.g.
The Tar Wars tobacco prevention curriculum includes elements from both of these social influence dimensions with discussions of tobacco use prevalence, physical consequences, costs and misrepresentations used in advertising.
This tobacco use prevention program is also consistent with guidelines by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control [ 18 ] which recommend inclusion of content which addresses the short term effects of tobacco use, social influences of tobacco use, marketing of tobacco products, initiation of educational programs in elementary school and soliciting community support.
To identify any studies that exerted a disproportionate influence on the summary treatment effect, we deleted individual studies one at a time.
This work was supported in part by a grant from Novartis Pharma AG Basel, but was carried out without influence from its sponsor.
To examine the influence of the available covariates in addition to the Fok I polymorphism on beta cell function and insulin sensitivity, we employed a stepwise regression analytical approach.
However, from the multivariate analysis result of %S (Table 2), we concluded that this polymorphism had an important impact on insulin sensitivity, which was independent of the influence of waist-hip ratio.
The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of APOE gene polymorphism in the development of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy in Type I diabetes patients.
The influence of the APOE gene polymorphism to the development of diabetic microangiopathy is uncertain.
Despite these efforts to be insure that the system was optimized in order to detect a steroid-mediated alteration of Stx responsiveness, the concern still exists that this system may not really reflect the influences of sex steroids in vivo.

Logistic regression [ 28 ] was used to explore the influence of each variable on the use of BCS vs. mastectomy.
Odds Ratios (OR) [ 29 ] with corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated to measure the degree of influence of variables on the utilization of BCS vs. mastectomy.
Also, we were unable to measure some factors that have been found to be important in other reports, in particular, influence of physician age [ 11 ] , physician specialty [ 42 ] , type of hospital (teaching hospitals and hospitals with radiation facilities, private, county and public) [ 36 38 39 43 ] , socio-economic status and education [ 42 ] , tumor-breast ratio and the expected cosmetic results [ 7 9 ] , physician/patient interactions before surgery [ 42 ] , and psychological factors, such as fear of radiation or cancer [ 9 ] . The strengths of using of insurance claims data for this analysis were twofold.
examined the potential influence that adoption of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and PSA testing had on increasing prostate needle biopsy rates in the SEER areas from 1986 through 1991 [ 17 ] . Both TRUS and PSA testing rates, initially near zero, increased to almost 2,000 and 20,000 per 100,000, respectively.
In our study, adjusting for TURP-detected cases allowed us to better assess the influence of screening on prostate cancer incidence trends.
The influence of blood products on LH infection
Although the biological mechanisms underlying the inverse association between menarcheal age and adult obesity are uncertain, it has been suggested that early maturing girls may have a longer period of positive energy balance [ 1 ] , or that various endocrine factors influence both the rate of sexual maturation and the accumulation of body fat [ 6 ] . However, it is also possible that the apparent influence of menarcheal age on adult obesity reflects the underlying importance of childhood obesity, with relatively fat children at increased risk for both early menarche [ 7 9 13 14 15 ] and adult obesity [ 7 16 ] .
A substantial proportion of girls in this study, however, experienced menarche close to age 11 y, and it is unclear if BMI levels at younger ages could also account for the apparent influence of menarcheal age on adult obesity.
Other results indicate that leptin may play a role in the initiation of puberty [ 25 ] , and each 1 ng/mL increase in serum leptin has been associated with a 1-month decrease in menarcheal age [ 24 ] . The apparent effect of early menarche on adult obesity may therefore result from the influence of childhood obesity on both the timing of menarche and the risk for adult obesity [ 16 ] . It should be realized, however, that although controlling for childhood BMI and TSF greatly reduced the inverse relation of menarcheal age to adult obesity, a relatively small, independent association remained.
More recent data indicate that black girls in the US, on average, experience menarche ~6 months earlier than do white girls [ 9 15 30 31 ] . Furthermore, the mean menarcheal age of black girls in Bogalusa decreased by approximately 9 months between 1973 and 1992 [ 15 ] . A somewhat similar, but not statistically significant, trend was also reported in a recent study, with the median menarcheal age of black girls decreasing by 5.5 months between 1960-70 and 1988-94 [ 31 ] . These trends may, at least in part, be due to the influence of various programs in the US, such as the National School Lunch Program, aimed at improving the nutritional status of children.
[ 7 ] found that adjustment for childhood (age 11 y) BMI levels 'substantially reduced', but did not eliminate, the apparent influence of early maturation on adult obesity.
Our findings indicate that much of the apparent influence of menarcheal age on adult obesity is, in reality, due to the influence of childhood obesity on both menarcheal age and adult obesity.

Although partners and grandmothers in Bolivia may have an influence on feeding decisions because of their emotional importance to the mothers, it is unlikely that they will exert much effect through the transmission of facts.
Intervention with antenatal breastfeeding support seems to have less effect on breastfeeding rates than trials offering only postnatal support [ 6 ] . In that context, the observation by Reiff and colleagues [ 8 ] that health care personnel may exert a stronger influence on mothers' infant-feeding practices with nonverbal teaching (the hospital "modeling" of infant formula products) than with verbal teaching is important.
[ 20 21 ] Many researchers have attempted to remove the influence of gestational age when studying predictors of birth weight by using the categories small- (SGA), large- (LGA), and appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA).
[ 16 24 25 ] However the reference median is chosen, this ratio will assume a linear relationship between birth weight and its influences across the range of birth weights, which may not be correct.
In addition to examining determinants of fetal growth, adjusting birth weight for gestational age is also needed to understand the influence of fetal growth on later outcomes.
Opinion Leaders were used to establish a communications channel into the existing regional physician social network, and in acknowledgement of the mediating effects of Opinion Leaders on the diffusion and acceptance of new ideas and products, such as the future practice tool [ 23 ] . Opinion Leader sampling was used to obtain the sought significant conceptual variation that stems from the Opinion Leaders' vast experience and influence [ 24 25 ] . To enhance the likelihood of variation among the identified Opinion Leaders, the Advisory Board members and DFM were directed to provide names of Opinion Leaders physicians from a range of practice locations (i.e.
In published literature about barriers to care, influences of drug lifestyles and poor treatment in the system are documented barriers.
Evidence suggests that alcohol may increase oxidative burden [ 12 13 14 15 ] . However, while alcohol could potentially act as an oxidant, there is a large body of evidence that wine has antioxidant properties [ 12 13 16 17 ] . Our data indicate that these antioxidant properties might exist and could have positive influence on lung function.
We investigated the influence of gender on the likelihood that a study patient achieved a favorable outcome (i.e.
We evaluated the bivariate relationships between gender and outcome with selected baseline covariates, and constructed a time-series repeated measures regression model [ 20 21 ] to describe the influence of gender on the outcome using data at baseline and two, six, nine and 12 months.
A proportional-hazards regression model was used to assess the influence of gender on one-year survival.
Because of this difference we created a proportional-hazards model to investigate the influence of gender on survival, controlling for baseline presentation of fever, diarrhea, serum β 2 microglobulin, CD4+ cell count, hemoglobin, BMI, cavitary disease, and extent of disease on chest x-ray.
To better characterize the influence of the effector on intron-splicing, we also carried out a series of growth experiments in liquid culture (Figure 4a).
Early recognition of the contrast between the stabilizing influences of density-dependent population regulation, and potentially de-stabilizing influences of environmental variation [ 1 ] , laid a foundation for theoretical modeling of population stability in stochastic environments [ 2 ] that assumes renewed relevance in light of current developments in ecology and climate research [ 3 ] . Recently, for instance, numerous studies have documented the influences of global-scale climatic variation on the population dynamics of vertebrates in widely diverse ecosystems (see, e.g., [ 4 5 ] for reviews), including species interactions at the community level [ 6 7 8 ] . To our knowledge, however, no study has yet documented a simultaneous and direct influence of large-scale climate on the dynamics at all trophic levels in a single system.

Such a pervasive influence could pose consequences for the persistence of biological communities if the climatic influence at any trophic level (or multiple levels) were strong enough to alter its dynamical stability [ 3 ] .
Such a pervasive influence could pose consequences for the persistence of biological communities if the climatic influence at any trophic level (or multiple levels) were strong enough to alter its dynamical stability [ 3 ] .
Here, we use empirical data on a three-trophic level system involving predators, herbivores, and vegetation, and a community-level model, to test for the influences of climate on the dynamics at and among individual trophic levels, while simultaneously accounting for the roles of intrinsic (density-dependent) and interspecific interactions.
Previously, we identified correlations between large-scale variation in winter climate, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) [ 9 ] , and: predation efficiency of wolves ( Canis lupus ), mortality of old moose ( Alces alces ), and growth dynamics of balsam fir ( Abies balsamea ) on Isle Royale [ 6 ] . Additionally, we have documented influences of the NAO, wolf predation, and density dependence on the intrinsic rate of increase in the moose population on Isle Royale [ 10 ] . Hence, the current analysis was motivated by the results of these earlier attempts to dissect the relative contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic processes to the dynamics of this community, as well as by a more general interest in developing a community-level model of climatic effects at and among multiple trophic levels that may subsequently contribute to our understanding of the implications of climatic change for community stability.
Quantifying the role of climatic variation in the dynamics at multiple trophic levels requires, however, a modeling framework that first accounts for the influence of interspecific and intrinsic processes on the dynamical structure at each level, so that the influence of intrinsic processes on the autoregressive (AR) structure of the time series data is not mistaken for a lagged influence of environmental stochasticity [ 11 ] .

Based on the approach used in the development of previous bivariate population models [ 12 13 14 ] , we developed and applied a model testing for the direct influence of large-scale climate on the dynamics at individual trophic levels and interactions among levels (Figure 1).
In contrast, the influence of large-scale climate was significantly weaker at the middle trophic level than at either the top or bottom trophic levels (Figure 3).
The results of our analysis corroborate previous observations of the limiting influences of winter climate in moose population dynamics [ 18 ] , of the mediating influence of winter climate in wolf-moose interactions [ 19 ] , of the roles of wolf predation and density dependence in moose dynamics [ 10 20 ] , and of the direct influence of winter climate on growth dynamics of balsam fir [ 6 ] on Isle Royale.

To our knowledge, however, this study constitutes the first documentation of direct and simultaneous influences of large-scale climate on the dynamics at multiple trophic levels in a single system.
Although many studies have documented influences of winter weather, particularly snow conditions, on wolf-prey interactions (e.g.
Evidence of influences of snow on wolf movement, social tendencies [ 24 ] and predation rates [ 6 ] suggests, however, that winter climate might affect wolf survival.
While we wish to avoid speculating as to potential mechanisms underlying the direct influence of the NAO on wolf dynamics indicated by our analysis (Table 1), it may be worth considering that residual variation in annual wolf mortality, after accounting for the influences of wolf density and pack size [ 6 ] , correlates negatively with the current-year NAO index (standardized r = -0.

As well, in the most parsimonious model of fir dynamics (Table 1), the lag-one autoregressive term includes the coefficients quantifying the influences of moose on fir (coefficient c 2 from equation 2c) and of fir on moose (coefficient b 3 from equation 2b).
It is worth recalling, however, that theory predicts that population stability depends on the relative strengths of intrinsic and environmental influences on population dynamics [ 2 ] . In this regard, it may be the observation that climate exerted its greatest influence on the dynamics of the top and bottom trophic levels (Figure 3) that is most relevant because, even if self regulation were equivalent at all three levels, it is at the levels most responsive to climate where we will see the greatest effects of climate change on dynamics and stability [ 3 ] .

Finally, we did not account for differences between patients' severity of illness, variations in residents' critical or palliative care experience, comfort in caring for dying patients or the influence of the fellow or attending physician on management decisions.
Capturing data on these other factors would have helped define their potential influence on resident responses.
Capsaicin's use in the treatment of chronic pain is due to an analgesic effect that is explained by capsaicin's action of depletion of stores of substance P from primary sensory neurons as a consequence of the reduced production of prostaglandin [ 39 60 ] . Capsaicin's antiphlogistic activity is due to the "counter-irritant effect"; which means that a local irritant effect exerts an additional more remote antiinflammatory effect [ 60 ] . This is explained by a liberation of corticoids under the influence of certain cutivisceral reflexes [ 60 ] . The counter-irritant effect on the gastric mucosa also occurs because capsaicin stimulates production of the cytoprotective prostaglandin E 2 [ 60 ] . Capsaicin produces analgesic and antiinflammatory effects because it inhibits both 5-lipoxygenase and cycoloxygenase [ 39 ] . A 10 g human ingestion of red pepper stimulated carbohydrate oxidation [ 62 ] . This may explain why the Chocó Indians used it to give their hunting dogs more "energy" [ 25 ] .

There is a possible explanation in light of the gender-specific differences observed in callosal size [ 24 ] coupled with the fact that prenatal exposure to EtOH causes feminization of male rats and defeminization of female rats [ 12 25 26 ] . There is a hormonal influence on the developing commissural pathway that could be disrupted by a number of EtOH-induced aberrations in hormone activity, such as the diminished perinatal surge of testosterone observed in EtOH-exposed male fetal rats [ 27 ] . The EtOH-induced attenuation of the testosterone surge eliminated the normal sex difference in rat callosal size.

They showed that the non-linear kinetics of ceftriaxone arise solely from this non-linear binding by demonstrating that the kinetics became linear if the free drug concentrations are used in the pharmacokinetic calculations.
The bottom row in these figures quantitates the influence of this early time error on the determination of the intestinal absorption rate by deconvolution by comparing the model rate (green) versus the deconvolution rate (black).
Principal outcomes measuring search frequencies and influence from searching were dichotomized into at least once a week and less often or no answer.
In addition, we set the threshold for judging statistical significance at p <= .001 to further reduce the influence of multiple comparisons on p values.
Besides it seems unlikely that this limitation had a significant influence on the results of this study when we consider the nature of most journal articles dealing with the topic of medical education.
English as a language barrier constitutes a huge problem [ 25 ] . Further the capability of selecting the right journal has an influence.
Additionally, practices that considered "prior user testimony" important in the selection process were 1.39 times more likely to agree with the scheduling subscale than those practices that did not consider prior user testimony as an important influence.
By contrast, practices that considered compatibility an important influence were less likely (OR = 0.66) to agree with financial analysis subscale.
However, the influence of race concurs with other investigations [ 11 12 ] ; race may have a significant influence on body temperatures and needs to be studied further.
Study findings draw attention to needed areas of research for better understanding of the influence of variables such as device, site, race, and age on body temperature assessments.
[ 7 ] It is becoming clear, however, that "managed care" is not a single entity, and that a wide range of economic incentives and disincentives may be created in various forms of managed care, [ 8 ] each likely to have different kinds of influence on clinician behavior.
Specifically, the influence of a potent PKC activator, PMA, and clinically tested drug, Bryostatin 1, on the IFNg-induced MHCII expression in several IFNg-resistant tumor cell lines was examined.
It is well established that, besides the MHCII molecules, IFNg can induce susceptible tumors to upregulate the expression of MHC class I antigens [ 43 ] , tumor associated antigens [ 44 ] , costimulatory molecules [ 45 ] , and heat shock proteins [ 46 ] . In addition, IFNg may have antimetabolic and antiproliferative influence on certain types of tumor cells [ 47 ] . It has also been suggested that IFNg may cause responding tumor cells to secrete angiogenesis inhibitors [ 48 ] . As it is not known which of those IFNg effects are missing or restored by PMA in LS1034 cells, a thorough evaluation of the possible clinical implications of our in vitro findings is quite difficult.
During the past years several epidemiological studies have underlined the relation between diet and incidence of coronary heart disease, and other diseases [ 16 17 18 ] . Dietary factors exert their influence largely through their effects on blood lipids and lipoproteins, as well as on the other established modifiable risk factors, with the exception of cigarette smoking.
Also, epidemiological studies suggest that the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower coronary heart disease risk, especially through the reduction of blood pressures, body mass index, and levels of several thrombogenic factors [ 12 13 18 19 ] . Recently, the findings from the Lyon Diet Heart study illustrate the potential importance of the Mediterranean dietary pattern, especially when compared to other recommended diets, like Step-I diet [ 19 ] . Also, results from a Spanish Study suggest that the monounsaturated fatty acids diets are associated with a significant reduction and a better control of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure [ 20 ] . However it still remains a matter of debate if the protective influence is primarily caused by single nutrients, e.g. dietary fatty acids, potassium or dietary fibre or if it can be attributed to the Mediterranean diet as a whole [ 12 ] .
Insulators seem to function not by deactivating cis -regulatory modules but by preventing their influence from being propagated along the chromosome.
This section presents an application of the proposed methodology to the standard clinical problem of testing influence of sleep inducing drugs on the sleep EEG.
We observe that selective MP-based estimates of power are more sensitive to the effect of influence of both drugs than the spectral integrals.
1. In the recording of patient ZCB09, which revealed a very low spindling activity (last row in Figures 16and 17), fluctuations in the background masked the power of sleep spindles to such an extent, that spectral integrals indicate a partially reverse trend, i.e. decrease of power of sleep spindles under the influence of midazolam.
At each examined frequency, the transmitting power of the dipole was increased until the implant showed an influence.
No influence on the ITREL-III was found during tests with GSM mobile phones despite a maximum transmission peak power of 1 W (1800 MHz) and 2 W (900 MHz).
Tests on other locations of the dipole relative to the phantom (near the ear, the loop or the meander) showed no influence up to a maximum available radiation power of 6 W. The uncertainty of the transmitting power measurement was less than ± 30%, and is basically composed of the uncertainty of the power measurement itself and the uncertainty of the direction coupler parameters.
Although the frequency of homologue separation increased with MG-132 dose, the sample size of 11 oocytes is much too low to comment about their possible origin or their influence on other abnormalities detected in MII oocytes.
Mobile source intake fractions may not be identical to residential intake fractions, and the values applied may be underestimates, given the importance of near-source impacts and the relatively low geographic resolution of models underlying our intake fraction estimates [ 22 ] . The lack of characterization of the influence of SO 2 emissions on nitrate concentrations also contributes uncertainty, although this is likely a relatively small bias on an annual average and nationally integrated basis.
In addition, insulation retrofits of this magnitude could have significant market influences.
There is a lack of clarity in the literature about the definition and influence of antimicrobial use.
Age also has no influence on overall frequency of promoter methylation.
We investigated the interaction of TGFβ 1 with the α V β 6 integrin and its influence on selected target genes known to be involved in cell cycle-regulated growth inhibition.
Influence of TGFβ 1 on cell growth is well established, but the mechanisms are not fully understood [ 75 76 77 78 79 ] . Here, we assayed for the possible synergistic function of α V β 6 integrin on mature TGFβ 1 mediated growth inhibition in Panc-1 cells.
Linking of the TGFβ-R pathway to the Ras/MAPK pathway is dependent on a functional SMAD4 gene product, because TGFβ 1 induced gene expression and activation of Ras and ERK1/2 is attenuated by the TGFβ-RII blocking antibody only in SMAD4 wild type cells, whereas in the SMAD4 deleted BxPC-3 cells, no such influence was observable.
In order to explain this discrepancy, it is noteworthy to mention that unrelated to its anti-glucocorticoid activity, RU486 also has antioxidant properties that have been suggested to play a role in the inhibition of cell growth caused by this compound [ 7 ] . Such an effect and/or other anti-glucocorticoid-independent influences by RU 486 appears to prevail in relation to the overall impact of this compound on cell proliferation, and may indeed suggest, at a first glance, a protective effect against the risk of hepatocellular cancer.
Among the factors that may influence the occurrence of cardiovascular disease the beneficial effect of physical activity on human health has been underlined in several studies [ 2 3 ] . The protective role of physical activity on cardiovascular morbidity has, mainly, attributed to its favourable effects on several "traditional" coronary risk factors, like body mass composition, and arterial blood pressures as well as to inflammation process [ 2 ] . On the other hand, the influence of physical activity on lipids levels showed conflicting results in the few large population studies that have evaluated this association [ 1 ] .
In addition, the influence of diet and genetic factors cannot be addressed by our data.
The purpose of this study was to determine if aging had an influence on muscle blood flow independent of habitual physical activity levels.
Future studies are needed to clarify the influence of age and activity level on oxygen delivery.
A didactic series of lessons was presented focusing upon the role of weight management, diet and physical activity in the prevention of essential hypertension and their beneficial influence upon blood pressure and other CVD risk factors based on National Institutes of Health guidelines on weight loss, diet (reducing salt and sodium intake) and increasing physical activity.
Six additional cases were studied for the extent of syncytium formation under various estrogen influences.
These data provide additional evidence that 4-AP exerts neither an anti-proliferative nor a pro-apoptotic influence on serum-supplemented GC cultures, because PCNA expression is a sensitive marker of GC proliferation and apoptosis [ 18 26 27 ] . The lack of 4-AP effect on GC viability is also evident from the flow cytometric analysis; the percentages of cells staining positive for propidium iodide were 8 ± 2% and 7 ± 2% in the presence and absence of drug (n = 4 samples of 10,000 cells/each from 4 GC isolations).
Asymmetric division may involve extrinsic (influence of adjacent cells) or intrinsic factors.
In other words, asymmetric division in vivo may be a result of the influence of both extrinsic and intrinsic factors.
There is a lack of fundamental information on potential influences of undernutrition on the functional morphology of ovaries of pregnant animals.
There were no significant influences of nutrition on weights of fetal ovaries or tissue concentrations of germ cells (Table 2).
However, human studies have failed to demonstrate a clear-cut influence of hormonal environment on disease susceptibility to lupus or other autoimmune disorders.
Excessively long CAG repeats in the AR are a rare cause of spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy [ 13], and AR repeat length appears to have an influence on the biology of certain tumors [ 14, 15].
However, human studies have failed to demonstrate a clear-cut influence of hormonal environment on disease susceptibility to lupus or other autoimmune disorders.
Excessively long CAG repeats in the AR gene are a rare cause of spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy [ 13], and AR repeat length appears to have an influence on the biology of certain tumors [ 14, 15].
It has been reported that CCR5 expression is upregulated in RA synovial fluid and synovial tissue T cells [ 10, 11, 12], and that CCR5 Δ 32 deletion may have an influence on clinical manifestations of RA [ 13], suggesting that CCR5 might play an important role in RA.
RA SCLs were stimulated with TNF-α, and chemokine production and the capacity of supernatants to influence monocyte migration were examined to assess the influence of inflammatory cytokines on chemokine production and monocyte trafficking.
We examined the influence of TNF-α on monocyte migration induced by RA SCL.
B cells proliferate and differentiate into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells under the influence of a combination of cytokines derived from T cells [ 8].
Yet the possible influence of high BMIs in mediating postoperative hip infections and further hip OA disability cannot be ignored.
The present results suggest that the influence of activated T cells on osteoclasts will probably change depending on when and where the T cells encounter the osteoclasts.
In conclusion, this examination of mammographic characteristics detected some associations with soy foods that suggest an influence of nutritional patterns on the development of the female breast.

Based on a series of unselected cases, in the present study we examined the possible influence of the amplification of the oncogenes c- myc and HER-2 / neu on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).
Averaged over the period 1995-99, age-adjusted invasive breast cancer rates per 100,000 white, non-Hispanic women were 199 in Marin County, 155 in the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area, and 144 in the United States as a whole [ 2 ] . Pronounced international and national geographic variation in breast cancer rates has been studied extensively [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 ] and has been attributed variously to population differences in the use of mammographic screening, diet, physical activity, body size, alcohol consumption, and socioeconomic and reproductive factors [ 5 6 7 9 10 ] . However, studies of breast cancer incidence among Asian migrants to North America have noted associations with age at migration, suggesting additional important influences of childhood or adolescent exposures or experiences [ 4 5 6 ] . With regard to Marin County, an earlier study by the Northern California Cancer Center (NCCC) using census data suggested that the high incidence was associated with the sociodemographic characteristics of the county and not with a geographically specific exposure [ 10 ] and that women living in Marin County have a higher prevalence of some recognized breast cancer risk factors, such as high education and income as well as low and late parity [ 10 11 ] .
Because OPOs assume patient management responsibility upon declaration of death, individual clinicians have no influence over events after this time.
Many of these patients were under the influence of sedation and the worst GCS would reflect the effect of sedation more than the true underlying mental status.
The stability of heart rate in face of a reduction in systemic vascular resistance in group A patients renders possible an influence of preoperative β-blocker therapy on haemodynamic compensation.
Most of these patients were still under the influence of postoperative sedation during the first 24 hours in ICU, and the worst GCS would reflect the effect of sedation more than the true underlying mental status.
It was therefore impossible to consider the influence of QTc prolongation on the occurrence of critical cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.
Ultimately, despite improving arterial oxygen content, PEEP may decrease oxygen delivery to various organs, among which the splanchnic vascular bed appears to be particularly at risk because of its predisposing features and the influence of PEEP on regional blood flow distribution.
These include the potential influence of local perfusion by contact with traditional laser Doppler probes [ 18], the small sampling area of single point measurements which, because of the spatial heterogeneity of the cutaneous microvasculature, might not be representative of overall flow [ 22, 23], and the long time needed to make multiple measurements.
There are three factors that could have a potential influence on the responsiveness of patients with ARDS to inhaled NO: (1) the anatomical remodeling of the pulmonary circulation; (2) the reduction of the lung volume accessible to gas, and (3) the presence of septic shock.
The exception is an analysis of the influence of GC content on average amino-acid composition in 59 bacterial species [ 56].
Conservation is a valuable clue to the relationships between organisms and the influence of events such as lateral gene transfer on the evolution of genomes.

To evaluate the influence of hybridization duration on intensity values, the 0.1 pM, 1 pM and 10 pM prokaryotic target concentrations were repeated in experiments where the hybridization time was extended to 32 h with all other conditions left unchanged.
For both 12- and 23-RSS, the positions exhibiting the strongest cooperative influence lie in the nonamer-proximal half of the spacer and in the heptamer and nonamer positions adjacent to the spacer (Figure 2).
Genes or exons which have a K a /K s ≈ 1 are inferred to evolve in the absence of functional constraint; genes or exons which have a K a /K s > 1 are inferred to evolve under the influence of positive selection.
However, the modern era of genomics has been accompanied by increasingly numerous claims that LGT is frequent [ 3, 4, 5, 6], and there now seems little doubt that LGT exerts a significant influence upon evolutionary histories.
Using the aminoacyl-tRNA synthases as an example of the modular-type entities asserted to be most amenable to LGT, Woese concludes that the genealogical trace of vertical gene flow is readable, despite a significant jumbling influence of LGT.
That is, older L1s and older families of LINEs may have had more influence on the exon composition of genes which themselves are generally rather old.
Our data suggest that in addition to androgen-independent positional influences on fibroblast phenotypes, the AR is originally involved in establishing stable and reproducible patterns of gene expression in stromal cells during genital differentiation, which are reflected in the differences in global gene-expression patterns between fibroblasts cultured from the genital skin of normal individuals and females affected by AIS.
Sequence features were added to the regression model as long as the p -values for their associated influence terms ( 
Additional studies focusing on the influence of alginate on PG-1 activity in a biofilm model are in progress.

The model law states, "The insurer shall not be liable for any loss sustained or contracted in consequence of the insured's being intoxicated or under the influence of any narcotic unless administered on the advice of a physician."
If the objective of the test is to estimate the chronic toxicity of the effluent in uncontaminated receiving water, the test may be conducted using dilution water consisting of a single grab sample of receiving water (if non-toxic), collected either upstream and outside the influence of the outfall, or with other uncontaminated natural water (ground or surface water) or standard dilution water having approximately the same characteristics (hardness, alkalinity, and conductivity) as the receiving water.
If the objective of the test is to determine the additive or mitigating effects of the discharge on already contaminated receiving water, the test is performed using dilution water consisting of receiving water collected immediately upstream or outside the influence of the outfall.
If the objective of the test is to estimate the chronic toxicity of the effluent in uncontaminated receiving water, the test may be conducted using dilution water consisting of a single grab sample of receiving water (if non-toxic), collected outside the influence of the outfall, or with other uncontaminated natural water (surface water) or standard dilution water having approximately the same salinity as the receiving water.
If the objective of the test is to determine the additive or mitigating effects of the discharge on already contaminated receiving water, the test is performed using dilution water consisting of receiving water collected outside the influence of the outfall.
If the objectives of the test require the use of uncontaminated receiving water as dilution water, and the receiving water is uncontaminated, it may be possible to collect a sample of the receiving water close to the outfall, but should be away from or beyond the influence of the effluent.

Instead, the acquisition environment emphasizes delaying knowledge capture and problem identification since these events can have a negative influence on obtaining annual program funding-a key to success for DOD managers.
Assessing the external environment is particularly important, in part because so many external forces that fall beyond an organization's influence can powerfully affect its chances for success.
An awareness of these potential users' interests and influence can help auditors understand why the program operates the way it does.
Auditors may use approaches drawn from the field of program evaluation to try to isolate the effects of the program from these other influences.
Factors outside the control or influence of management can affect the entity's ability to achieve all of its goals.
These early decisions thus have a disproportionately greater influence on a facility's ultimate performance, quality, cost, and schedule than decisions made later in the process.

There could be many influences on what is happening and these influences could interact in nonlinear ways such that a unit of change in the input can be associated with quite different changes in the output, sometimes increasing it, sometimes decreasing it, and sometimes having no discernible effect.
is a less complex question because the criterion is fairly clear, the focus is narrow, the influences on compliance are likely to be relatively few, and the relation of input and output is likely to be fairly direct.
Influences on compliance are likely to be relatively few: staff knowledge of procedures, staff training in their implementation, functioning equipment, number of staff compared to workflow, degree of supervision, staff screening and selection
Influences on achievement of sufficient procedures likely to be many, including the state of the art of detection technologies, number and militancy of potential threats to security, and the willingness of passengers, airline personnel, and airport personnel to accept different costs and forms of protection

In addition, our task used money as the secondary reinforcer, which might be a powerful influence on humans but has little biological relevance for other animals, and certainly none in the social domain that I was interested in.
Other areas where biologists have well-developed theories of the influences and impacts of niche construction include co-evolutionary theory, where the environmental feedbacks are largely biotic, and Dawkins' theory of the extended phenotype.
‘The French and Germans and others have elements of that but they also have what you might call more “state-funded science”, scientists as civil servants, and there is obviously much greater possibility of science being funded for less than the best scientific reasons,’ notes Morgan, referring to the opportunities for greater political influence on decision-making.
And size and temperature even explain much of the variation in mortality rates between species—which one might have thought to be strongly dependent on external factors such as predators—perhaps through metabolism's influence on aging processes, such as free-radical damage to the genome.
, nicotine, sleep deprivation, or Parkinson's disease) had its influence.
The microelectrode strategy was quickly adopted to alert animals, making it apparent that higher level brain areas involved in operations upon input might feedback their influences on earlier processing stages [9,10].
The authors clearly state that the company had “a nonbinding input on issues of study design and analyses” but it had “no influence on reporting of the data or the decision to publish.”
Scientific journals are slowly disentangling themselves from unhealthy industry influence over what they publish, and public access to clinical trial data is daily a closer reality [9].

For instance, leisure activities represent a combination of influences.
We have better evidence that good brain health is multiply determined, that brain development early in life matters, and that genetic influences are of great importance in accounting for individual differences in cognitive reserve and in explaining who develops Alzheimer disease and who does not.
Taken together, these results suggest the existence of a reciprocal relationship between isoprenoid-mediated Rho/ROCK signaling and sAPP α shedding, i.e., activation of ROCK1 blocks basal and stimulated shedding while ROCK1 inhibition apparently relieves a tonic negative influence exerted on shedding by ROCK1 activity.
Multiple risk factors, including both genetic and environmental influences, interact in complex and often unknown ways to cause disease and disability in children.
Muscle contractions are initiated under the influence of the motor nerve by release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which triggers actin–myosin crossbridge cycling (Figure 3).

P LoS Medicine was launched at a time of unprecedented concern about the influence of hidden competing interests on the medical literature.
Financial relationships between industry, researchers, and academic institutions are widespread [4], and disclosing these competing interests is a crucial step in helping to protect the public and the reputation of authors and of PLoS Medicine . Disclosure also matters because there is increasing evidence that authors' competing interests have a strong influence on their conclusions.

According to Steve Morgan, “Anecdotal evidence suggests that ALLHAT has had an influence on prescription practices, but I am not aware of a large-scale analysis yet.”
In particular, one important unresolved issue in the burgeoning literature on lifecourse analysis of health concerns how well early life social circumstances are measured, since this these data are essential for distinguishing between the influence of early life and adult conditions on adult health status [8,9].
Both of these individuals contend that pharmaceutical industry influence over their employers (a state and a federal regulatory agency, respectively) played a part in the difficulties these individuals faced in getting their concerns heard [1,2].
Lenzer's report will, we hope, spark discussion and debate about how American medicine—clinicians, researchers, regulatory agencies, and medical journals—can disentangle itself from the influence of the pharmaceutical industry.
The scientist had read my articles on whistleblowers who had raised concerns about the undue influence of the pharmaceutical industry on American medicine My industry source had information for me about drug company practices, but—out of fear of career ruin—would only talk on the condition that I would conceal the scientist's identity.
Twin studies suggest the relevance of small but significant shared environmental influences that are likely prenatal in origin.
Thus, schizophrenia is best viewed as a complex trait resulting from both genetic and environmental etiological influences.
Searching for genetic influences that mediate vulnerability to schizophrenia is rational, given the larger overall effect size and lesser error of measurement in comparison to typical assessments of environmental effects.
The authors also note another issue that has received surprisingly little attention in infectious disease models, namely, the influence of incubation and infectious period distributions on the invasion dynamics of an infection into a largely susceptible population—despite its obvious application to emerging infections and possible “deliberate exposure.”
Under the influence of western missionaries, many African Christian organizations still promote evangelical formulae in which, it is taught, creation was originally good, but then the “fall” of humankind occurred, which is bad, and finally, redemption is available only for the chosen.

Except for the last named tissue where IDO is expressed constitutively, IDO is inducible by inflammatory mediators, including interferons.
Various efficient algorithms to infer gene duplications on a gene tree by comparing it to a species tree have been described (for example: by Eulenstein [ 11 ] , and by Zhang [ 12 ] ). We developed a simple algorithm (named SDI for Speciation Duplication Inference) that appears to solve this problem even more efficiently on realistic data sets, though it has an asymptotic worst-case running time that is less favorable [ 13 ] .
The third, named "bpseq," is a simple text format that contains the sequence, one nucleotide per line, its position number, and the position number of the pairing partner (or 0 if that nucleotide is unpaired in the covariation-based structure model).
Based upon the numbering of the reference sequence, each helix is named for the position number at the 5' end of the 5' half of the helix.
For example, the first 16S rRNA helix, which spans E. coli positions 9-13/21-25, is named "9;" the helix at positions 939-943/1340-1344 is named "939."
For example, the first 16S rRNA helix, which spans E. coli positions 9-13/21-25, is named "9;" the helix at positions 939-943/1340-1344 is named "939."
Base pair frequencies are presented for a) all base pairs in the current covariation-based structure models, b) tentative base pairs predicted with covariation analysis, and c) base pairs previously proposed with comparative analysis that are not included in our current structure models due to a lack of comparative support from the analysis with our best covariation methods on our current alignments (named "Lousy" base pairs).
In parallel, with the significant advancements in computational and networking hardware and software, our need for more detailed and quantitative comparative information for each RNA molecule under study, and our interest in studying more RNA molecules beyond 16S and 23S rRNA, we have greatly expanded our web site, and named it the "Comparative RNA Web" (CRW) Site.
The first step was to name one of the arrays as the baseline in the comparative analysis program (Microarray Suite 5.0).
A different array was then named as the baseline.
These steps were repeated until all 12 arrays had been named as the baseline.
Accordingly, the technique is named Universal Sequence Map (USM).
In addition, transcription factors that were not readily aligned with a family, but have been documented and studied were placed together in the appropriately named "Orphans Family".
The SRE binds a transcription factor named serum response factor (SRF) which was found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for serum induction of the SRE [ 3, 4, 5].
The transcriptional regulatory activities of Smad1 in the nucleus are associated with its ability to directly bind to DNA [ 12 ] , its interaction with other DNA-binding transcription factors, such as OAZ, SIP1 and Hoxc-8 [ 13 14 15 ] , and also its interaction with the master transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300 [ 16 ] . Smad4 is an essential functional partner in Smad-regulated transcription and also interacts with CBP/p300 via a domain within the central linker region named as SAD (Smad Activation Domain) [ 13 ] . Since CBP/p300 has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and participates in chromatin remodeling, the recruitment of CBP/p300 into the DNA-binding complexes of Smad1 and Smad4 is likely a critical step in Smad-regulated gene activation.
The 26S proteasome is responsible for the bulk turnover of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in eukaryotic cells and also plays a key role in the regulation of cell cycle, signal transduction, transcription as well as antigen presentation [ 17 18 19 20 21 ] . Most of the known proteasomal substrates are marked and targeted to proteasome by ubiquitination [ 17 19 20 ] . Ubiquitination, however, is not an obligatory step for substrate targeting to proteasome [ 17 18 20 ] . The degradation of the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine synthesis, involves a protein named antizyme (Az), which binds and targets ODC to 26S proteasome for degradation [ 18 ] . However, ODC has remained an "orphan" in Az-dependent proteasomal degradation.
The second group contains four known proteins: GST (clone 13), MBP-1 (c-Myc promoter Binding Protein, clone 14) [ 28 ] , Smad1 (clone 17), TAG (Tumor Associated Gene, clone 31) [ 29 ] and PAG (Proliferation Associated Gene, clone 35) [ 30 ] . The third group contains four novel proteins: clone 19, 12, 27 and 28, which we named as SNIP1, SIP2, SIP3 and SIP4, respectively.
1, clone 19 encodes a novel nuclear protein named as Smad1 Nuclear Interacting Protein-1 (SNIP-1).
Western blot analyses using an anti-SNIP1 antibody detected two forms of SNIP1 with slightly different mobility, which are named as SNIP1.A and SNIP1.B (Fig.

Two GCN2-like genes were identified and named ifkA (NCBI accession AAM43647) and ifkB (NCBI accession AAM33717).
MoeZ is one of several MSAE-like conceptually translated protein sequences identified by the M. tuberculosis genome sequencing group at Sanger Center [ 14 ] . Although coding for a putative protein with high sequence similarity to MoeB, moe Z was so named because it had no genetic linkage to other MPT-Mo synthesis genes.
Runx genes encode the sequence-specific DNA binding subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor, the defining feature of which is the Runt domain, a highly conserved 128 amino acid sequence involved in DNA binding, heterodimerization, nucleotide binding, and nuclear localization [ 1 2 ] . The Runt domain is named after the first member of the family to be discovered, the regulatory gene runt from Drosophila melanogaster . Runx genes have also been discovered and functionally characterized in mammals, sea urchins and nematodes, and in general are involved in the transcriptional control of developmental processes [ 3 4 ] . In humans, mutations in each of the three Runx genes are associated with disease caused by defective control of cell proliferation and/or differentiation [ 4 5 ] . Most studies of Runx gene function and regulation have been carried out in mammals and in D. melanogaster , each of which has multiple Runx genes.
The newly identified Drosophila Runx gene sequences (CG1379 and CG15455) are present in a single sequence file (see Supplemental Table 1) and with opposite coding orientation and were named for this study RunxA (CG1379) and RunxB (CG15455).
Although originally named because of their ability to induce bone and cartilage formation [ 15 ] , BMPs are involved in many developmental processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, and intercellular interactions during morphogenesis [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ] . Members of the bone morphogenetic protein family function in a gene dosage dependent manner during development and participate in ocular development [ 26 27 28 29 ] . Therefore, mutations that alter the level of BMPs or alter the degree of BMP signaling are candidates to contribute to Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and other conditions involving anterior segment malformation, elevated IOP, and glaucoma.
Genetic screens have identified a large number of genes, named SNF (Sucrose Non-Fermenting) that are required for derepression of SUC2 transcription in the absence of glucose [ 16, 17, 18].
Biochemical and cell biological experiments indicate that Net1 acts as part of a complex named RENT that tethers Cdc14 to the nucleolus and inhibits Cdc14 phosphatase activity, and that CDC15 and TEM1 are required for the release of Cdc14 from Net1 at the end of mitosis [ 15 16 17 43 ] . Consistent with this notion, both net1 tab 2-1(which encodes a mutant version of Net1 with presumably reduced affinity for Cdc14) and CDC14 TAB 6-1(which encodes a mutant version of Cdc14 with reduced affinity for Tab2/Net1) bypass cdc15Δ [ 15 18 ] . Both net1 tab 2-1and CDC14 TAB 6-1impinge directly on mitotic exit, suggesting that other TAB genes may encode physiological regulators and effectors of the Mitotic Exit Network.
A long terminal repeat from a human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) was shown to drive the expression of an intergenic transcript from an unknown gene named HERV-HLTR associating 1 (HHLA1) and human otoconin-90 (OC90) to produce a transcript that is highly expressed in teratocarcinoma cells but not in normal human tissues or cell lines [ 33 ] . In the mouse, a Prion-like downstream gene named doppel (Dpl) was found to have an intergenic transcript that is upregulated in Prion-deficient mice [ 34 ] . The deletion of the Prion gene in these mice removes the splice acceptor site of exon 3, causing the normal Prion transcript to skip the deleted exon and inadvertently upregulate the normally low-abundance intergenic transcript by forcing it to splice more often to the doppel gene.

Several components of the yCCR4-associated complexes have already been identified in humans: two homologs of yPOP2 (named hCAF1 and hPOP2/hCALIF) [ 16 17 18 19 ] , and homologs of NOT proteins (named hNOT1, hNOT2, hNOT3, hNOT4) [ 19 ] . Moreover, interactions between these proteins were demonstrated [ 19 20 ] . Yet, at the present time there has been no report of a human protein that would be structurally and functionally close to yCCR4.

Yet, at the present time there has been no report of a human protein that would be structurally and functionally close to yCCR4.
1C) designed from the predicted open reading frame, allowed us to provide the entire coding sequence of this gene (named d.nocturnin; assigned GenBank accession number AY043266; Table 1).
The second family, hereafter named the 3635 family, contains as yet unknown proteins from C. elegans, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens (Table 1).
The fourth family (hereafter named the CCR4 family) contains the formerly identified yeast CCR4 protein and as yet undefined human, murine, drosophila, caenorhabditis and arabidopsis proteins.
The human protein (named hCCR4) is putatively encoded by the KIAA1194 full-length cDNA ( [ 27 ] , accession number AB033020).
The cDNA encoding the murine protein (named mCCR4) was isolated by us using RT-PCR and primers derived from matching EST clones, and its open reading frame was entirely sequenced (assigned GenBank accession number AY043269; Table 1).
1C) demonstrated that the caenorhabditis and drosophila putative proteins (hereafter named ceCCR4 and dCCR4, with assigned GenBank accession numbers AY043268 and AY043267, respectively; Table 1) also possess, in their N-terminal region, a LRR motif related to that of the yCCR4 protein (Fig.
Two homologs of yPOP2 have been identified in mammals: the mouse/human CAF1 [ 11 16 17 33 ] and, more recently, the human homolog named hPOP2 or hCALIF [ 18 19 ] . Both mCAF1 [ 11 ] and hPOP2 [ 19 ] interact with yCCR4, and the yCCR4 LRR is essential for these interactions.
Construction of the deleted fusion protein in which four out the five hCCR4 leucine-rich repeats are removed (named pGal4-hCCR4(ΔLRR)) was performed in three steps.
The proteins were named BTBD1 and BTBD2 according to a recent analysis of their genomic sequences [ 21 ] . The clones of each contig differed in the amount of 5' sequence present: 11/15 and 15/19 of BTBD1 and BTBD2, respectively, had different 5' ends.
Transcripts, using HUGO (LocusLink) symbols of named loci are indicated below the scale line of build 29.
Depending on the print batch, the arrays contained from 42,772 to 43,915 spots (41,931-42,602 distinct clones representing 16,907-18,417 named genes, 3946-4145 ESTs with known functions and 19,369-21,384 ESTs with unknown functions), and were manufactured as previously described [ 31 32 33 ] . Following hybridization, the arrays were washed with 2X SSC with 0.05% SDS once for 2 min at room temperature, 1X SSC for 2 min at room temperature, 0.2X SSC three times for 1 min at 45-50°C.
We named this domain the CYTH ( Cy aB, th iamine triphosphatase) domain after the two experimentally characterized proteins in which it is present.
An offline version of the QuartOP web page is available as a compressed archive named supp_material.zip and as a self-extracting archive supp_material.exe for Microsoft Windows users.
This index.html file is located in the root directory named "offline_quartops".
The protein was named LeFPP for tomato filament-like plant protein.
The seven Arabidopsis ORFs were named AtFPP1 - AtFPP7 (Fig.
The history of the T locus began with the discovery in 1927 of a semi-dominant mutation in mice, named Brachyury , or T for tail, that affects both embryonic viability in homozygotes and tail development in heterozygotes [ 1 ] . This original T allele represents a deletion spanning 160-200 kb (reviewed in [ 2 ] ), the developmental effects of which have been well characterized [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 ] . Homozygous mutant embryos show a developmental failure of the notochord and posterior mesoderm, and die at midgestation.
This group includes a small number of named genes for which no function has yet been assigned but primarily contains the results of full-length cDNA sequencing projects or genes predicted by gene finding software.
The encoded proteins did not contain any recognizable functional motifs (figure 3) and were most similar to an uncharacterized human protein named B29 (figure 2).
An orthologous protein has recently been reported from rat and named sodium channel associated protein 1A (SCAP1A).

Our studies revealed the existence of a new member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule-based molecular motors, which we have named KIF27.
This protein, now named SMYD2, contains SET and MYND domains that are characteristic of proteins with chromatin remodeling capabilities.
Each clone was named according to its position in the original 96-well plate, for example, clone 1030 came from position 30 in plate 1. Vector sequences were first scanned in batch mode for the presence of vector-derived sequences using Contig Express and these sequences were trimmed before proceeding.
The presence of this hereby named TMC signature sequence motif CWETXVGQEly(K/R)LtvXD is our defining criterion for this novel TMC protein family (Figures 1, 2, additional file 2).
Because the middle domain of the SGCs is always associated with the HNOB domains (see below), we named it the HNOBA ( HNOB A ssociated) domain.
Btk was shown to be required for normal phosphorylation of a novel adapter protein, named BCAP, which couples BCR-activated PTKs to PI 3-kinase activation [ 17].
These sequences were named tentatively after ZAS-N or ZAS-C correspondingly, and a suffix, a number given in the order of plasmid DNA preparation.
These monoclonal antibodies were named as 3D 5 ABIR, 1D 11 ABIR, 2G 9 ABIR, 1F 7 ABIR, and 5D 6 ABIR.
First, PfPP5 contained the catalytic core found in all Ser/Thr phosphatases of the PPP family, including the signature motifs such as GDXHGQ, GDFVDRG, RGNHE, HGLL, and SAPNYCD, to name a few [ 22 23 ] . Site-directed mutagenesis and structural studies in PP 1 and PPλ have previously established the roles of specific amino acid residues in these domains in the various aspects of catalysis, such as metal ion binding, phosphate recognition, and co-ordination of water molecules [ 24 25 26 ] .
We have therefore, tentatively named this enzyme PfPP5.
These obstacles have been largely circumvented by the use of cloned viral cDNA that is then altered by standard DNA-based site-directed mutagenesis procedures [ 8 9 ] . Originally designed for influenza virus minigenomes [ 10 ] , such cDNA-based "reverse genetics" strategy has been adopted in a large number of NNR viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and measles, to name a few [ 11 12 13 14 ] . Recently, extension of this approach has resulted in the cloning of full-length viral cDNA capable of producing infectious recombinant virus particles upon transcription.
We have named this technique "HOOF-Prints" for Hypervariable Octameric Oligonucleotide Finger-Prints.
In addition, we show that two other evolutionarily conserved regions located close to the Ets site (provisionally named CD5X and CD5Y) play a role in CD5 expression.
A note about nomenclature: We name mutant homodimers by placing the numeral "2" in front of the amino acid substitution.
We name heterodimers by listing both substitutions, with the mutation in the 5'-monomer given first, for example V29A-Y85H, V29A-T91I, or V29A-WT, where WT refers to the wild-type sequence.
A transformant shown to contain the 1976 bp hnt2Δ::kanMX2 product in place of the wild-type 1200 bp HNT2 product was named strain BY16.
3seem to reflect those observed with ATF-BPTI and endostatin naming a 10-fold difference between Wag/Rij and Brown Norway rats.
Initial analysis of approximately 157,000 SAGE tags from PC12 cells cultured without or with NGF for 9 days revealed nearly 800 transcripts (of a total of at least 21,000) that are regulated by ± 6-fold or greater in response to NGF [ 11 ] . Of these, approximately 150 were assignable to named genes of known functions that regulate cellular behaviors ranging from actin and microtubule cytoskeleton assembly/disassembly, gene transcription, RNA processing, neurotransmission, and energetics.
We previously cloned a zebrafish BDNF transcript that appeared to contain two exons and thus suggested that the zebrafish and mammalian BDNF genes have similar organizations [ 4 ] . We recently cloned the zebrafish BDNF gene and identified the previously cloned 5' exon in the genomic clone [ 27 ] . The exon was named exon 1c.
The sequences were compared with the sequences of subclones of the genomic BDNF clone c241 which we had previously identified and partially sequenced [ 27 ] . Five of the ten sequenced 5' RACE clones contained the already known and previously cloned 5' exon [ 4 ] . This exon was named exon 1c because it contains a 39 nucleotide segment in which 37 nucleotides are identical with a segment in rat exon III, suggesting the two exons are orthologous (see table 1 and figure 2a) [ 25 ] .
The shorter more 5' exon was named exon 1b, and the more 3' exon exon 1b' (see figure 2).
This segment was named highly conserved sequence 2, or HCS2 (see table 1 - additional file 1).
The exon was named exon 1a.
The subclone was named Dex1aDS.
This construct was named AJ.
In this construct, which was named AJ/Pst, intron 1b, exon 1b' and most of intron 1c, totalling 3.6 KB, are eliminated.
This construct, which was named DOA5 was injected into sets of 150 and 250 embryos.
It is also known that the biological actions of NKA, NKB and SP are mediated by three receptors, named neurokinin (NK)-1, NK-2 and NK-3 [ 2 ] . Thus, the tachykinins have been implicated in several physiological actions such as salivation, the regulation of smooth muscle contraction, depolarization of central neurons, hyperactivity, interaction with dopaminergic A-10 neurons mediating behavioral activation, regulation of blood pressure, and the transmission of the baroreceptor reflex [ 3 4 5 6 7 ] . In addition, a loss of tachykinin-containing neurons has been described in neurodegenerative diseases [ 8 ] , suggesting that the decrease in the amount of tachykinins could be involved in these and other diseases [ 9 10 ] .
Vitamin A (retinol) is the prototype of a class of natural and synthetic chemical compounds named the retinoids.
A translational fusion between green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the Arabidopsis Constitutive Photomorphogenesis1 protein (COP1) has been established as a reporter for trans-silencing events in Arabidopsis [ 27 ] . A cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter driven GFP-COP1 locus, named C73, exemplifies an epigenetically active trans-silencer locus.
It is being replaced by the manufacturer company with equivalent equipment named the TOF-Watch series (written personal communication from Biometer International A/S, Odense, Denmark, 1999), unable to retain data and therefore require to be connected into a computer.
Named after Andreas Rett who first recognized the disorder in 1966 [ 2 ] , the syndrome is characterized by a constellation of clinical findings that have resulted in the establishment of clinical criteria for the diagnosis [ 3 ] . Common clinical features include early normal development until approximately 6-18 months of age followed by a period of developmental stagnation and subsequent regression, usually by 3 years of life.
[ 52 ] . AG126 belongs to a group of tyrosine kinase inhibitors named tyrphostins.
Of the original 192 G418-resistant clones that were harvested only one, named F3, was also resistant to 6-thioguanine and sensitive to growth in HAT medium (fig 3b).
We developed an ECG signal processing, analyzing, and database Web portal, which we named e-MOUSE™, accessible to the biotechnology community.
They used an apparatus named 'coincidence analyzer' which was able to determine the absolute time delay of the onset of inspiration precisely after the preceding R wave - see Footnote 1 - and which calculated the 'coupling rate' on the basis of the distribution of the detected time lags.
Additionally there are records of a specific ant that was given to dogs by Guyanese Amerindians in order to make them good hunters [ 21 ] . Amerindians also named their hunting dogs after ants and a wasp called "warribisi" that caught prey.
The predicted protein, named PPα, was 889 amino acid long, and contained a unique N-terminal extension of about 500 amino acids.
This method also named multiplexed bead assay is comprised of spectrally discrete particles, which can be used to quantitative soluble particles, in this case cytokines using a fluorescence based detection mechanism and flowcytometric analysis.
CMV = cytomegalovirus; EIA = enzyme immunoassay; gB = glycoprotein B; OD = optical density; RNP = ribonucleoprotein; Sm = ribonucleoproteins recognized by antibodies from a patient named Smith; U1-70 kD = component of the U1 ribonucleoproteins.
We have shown that α-actinin is abundant in the bone marrow stroma matrix, presumably at focal adhesion sites [ 5 ] . We have also reported that a 31 kDa amino-terminal α-actinin fragment, which we have named mactinin, is generated by the degradation of extracellular α-actinin by monocyte-secreted urokinase [ 6 ] . Furthermore, we have demonstrated that mactinin is present in inflammation caused by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, by examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice with infection [ 6 ] . It was not present in mice not challenged with P. carinii , suggesting that inflammaton is necessary for mactinin formation.
In this study, we report a novel mechanism of cell growth inhibition by the second generation of HPCs, named SAHA, which is 2000-fold more potent than HMBA and bears at least one hydroxamide in place of the amides in HMBA [ 17].
Vertebrate HB genes are divided into two classes: Class I genes (HOX genes) are organized into four clusters (HOX A, B, C, D) with a total of 39 members [ 8 ] . Members of Class II are also called divergent genes, including genes such as PAX, MSX, IRX, and DLX, named after their homologs in Drosophila (paired, muscle segment, Iroquois, and distal-less, respectively) [ 9 10 ] . Accumulating evidence suggests that homeobox genes are important in malignant transformation.
Extensive evidence indicates that both FGF-1 and FGF-2 are potent angiogenic factors, providing support for their use as stimuli for therapeutic angiogenesis in vivo . It is also important to note that many cell types express one of the four FGF receptors, and that FGF has been shown to have biological effects in a number of cell systems including induction of neurite outgrowth, suppression of skeletal muscle differentiation, induction of bone formation and neuroprotection, to name just a few.
VEGF-A also increases vascular permeability, with an effect 10,000 times more potent than that of the vasoactive substance histamine; VEGF-A was originally purified based on this property, and was named vascular permeability factor [ 3].
The isoforms are named by the number of amino acids that comprise the proteins; the human isoforms include VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206.
Furthermore, MJ1477 and its orthologs do not have the accessory domains found in all known CysRS, namely the DALR domain (named after a distinct amino-acid signature), which is shared by aaRSs of several specificities, and another domain specific to CysRS [ 19].
oleovorans protein also named AlkB.
We named the gene with the HUGO-approved symbol
All named expressed genes were added to the mouse testis transcriptome gene list.
The classes have been named according to the order in which each class was first discovered except for myosins I and II.
Phylogenetic analysis using these myosins indicated that the ATM myosins were a unique class and they were named class VIII.
This site has been named the TEDS rule site on the basis of these amino acids [ 8].
Therefore, it should usually be feasible to name a protein family (or superfamily) at a hierarchical level that encompasses all substrate specificities of its member proteins.
Multidomain proteins whose domains have separable counterparts elsewhere must be appropriately named to facilitate comparisons (see Table 2).
In Bacillus subtilis the gene, appropriately enough, has been named aroA, but in Escherichia coli the equivalent function is represented by genes encoding three differentially regulated paralogs.
These E. coli genes have been named aroF, aroG and aroH.
The status of nomenclature for the tryptophan pathway is not so chaotic as the genes in almost all prokaryotes have been named in line with E. coli, but even here distinct problems have arisen because gene fusions that exist in E. coli are often absent elsewhere.
The nomenclature we advocate is more easily remembered because genes are named in the order of pathway reaction.
Subunits for a given reaction are named at the same hierarchical level: anthranilate synthase (first reaction) consists of TrpAa and TrpAb, and tryptophan synthase (fifth reaction) consists of TrpEa and TrpEb.
However, in every case where we use the Osr acronym in this paper to refer to a previously named family, we also include any pre-existing name(s) for the family (for example, Osr15/Tos12, Osr26/Rire2 ).
Although Osr30 is the largest family of LTR retroelements in the genome, it has not been previously named.
We named it the PRC-barrel after the photosynthetic reaction center subunit H, in which it was first observed.
A script, named Mouse Gene Selection NCBI (MGS_NCBI), was written in JAVA and used to parse BLAST results from NCBI.
There are three major infrastructure components of the pipeline: the database, the Perl module (named Pipeline), and sufficient computational power, allocated by a job-management system.
As alternatively spliced transcripts are added to a gene model, they are sequentially named and numbered to associate them with that annotation.
The major change that had to be made to the FlyBase controlled vocabulary to support this project was to name the developmental intermediates that arise during embryogenesis, that is anlagen, primordia, and anlagen in statu nascendi.
Accordingly, this domain was named the KilA-N (terminal) domain (Table 2).
Transgenic lines are named as the construct, followed by the chromosome of insertion in parentheses, followed by a unique line designation.
As this conserved domain is present in at least three distinct classes of proteins related to Golgi dynamics (animal Sec14 proteins, the p24 family and GCP60-like proteins), we name this conserved region the GOLD domain.
Of the named genes, many have not been previously recognized as responsive to androgen.
We named this domain the SWIRM domain after the proteins SWI3p, Rsc8p and Moira in which it was first recognized.
A dendrogram (Figure 1) that summarizes the results seen in the phenogram (see Additional data files) was constructed by collapsing branches that were relatively well separated from the rest of the tree, and naming the collapsed branch, guided by previously proposed subfamily nomenclature [ 9, 10, 11].
In an attempt to provide greater resolution of clusters evident in the phenogram, some of the larger subfamilies were split into sets of smaller individually named branches.
The overall accuracy of the phenogram is suggested by the clustering of similarly named proteins, the relatively good agreement with previously published categorization schemes [ 9, 10, 11], and the high level of congruence with the previously published tree of human tyrosine kinases [ 40].
This method for estimating the novelty within the collection ignores the occasional unnamed family member whose GenBank annotation suggests probable membership in the EPK family, and the exceptional named family member (RNasel) whose GenBank annotation overlooks similarity to the EPK family.
EPK family members which have been previously named as EPKs, categorized into an EPK subfamily, or whose description clearly suggests they are EPK family members were assigned a status of 1. EPKs whose names or description suggest that the annotator recognized the existence of the protein without giving a clear indication of its similarity to EPKs beyond a similarity score calculated by automated annotation processes were assigned a status of 2. EPKs whose GenBank annotation did not clearly delineate the encoded protein or its potential function were assigned a status of 3. The tableis presented in comma separated values (csv) format, and is best viewed with a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.
Thus, the model contains OntologyEntries, whose roles are named to fit their purpose; for example, BioSequences has an OntologyEntry named 'species', which should be used to refer to an entry in the NCBI taxonomy database.
A few simple rules were used to translate MAGE-OM into the DTD named MAGE-ML.
Each of the APIs use similarly named methods and classes to provide access to their objects.
The pathway of tryptophan biosynthesis consists of five steps, and we have used the convention [ 30] of naming the genes in the order of the steps, trpA, trpB, trpC, trpD and trpE.
The α and β subunits of trpA are named trpAa and trpAb, and the α and β subunits of trpE are named trpEa and trpEb.
The α and β subunits of trpA are named trpAa and trpAb, and the α and β subunits of trpE are named trpEa and trpEb.
We then constructed an overall CSE set, which includes all CSEs found from both MGSCv3 and Cel2 (named as aCSE) and its human primary set (named as aCSE-hp).
We then constructed an overall CSE set, which includes all CSEs found from both MGSCv3 and Cel2 (named as aCSE) and its human primary set (named as aCSE-hp).
The 50 most highly induced named genes are shown in Figure 3. Twenty percent of these genes are either involved in NFκB signal transduction or directly activated by NFκB.
Of the 50 named genes most highly induced in all infections, 40% are either involved in NFκB signaling, or are responsive to NFκB activation.
These transcripts were not detected in the absence of DOX in the adult males and this putative gene was named Red herring ( Rdh ). Northern analysis using a probe from encore exon 3 indicated that levels of the normal sized encore transcript were not detectably altered by DOX, as indicated by the arrowhead (Figure 3a).
Line PdL(3)2C33 contains an insert at the 5' end of a gene with homology to a maltose permease from Bacillus stearothermophilus [ 37], which was named Sugar baby (Figure 3c).
ASW mRNA is interesting because sex-specific splicing of doublesex mRNA in Drosophila , a sex-determining gene for which the mammalian DMRT genes were named, is mediated in part by ASF/SF2 [ 38].
The cDNA library (named Bird_Rao_ Meloidogyne_incognita _J2) was constructed using the Zap Express cDNA Synthesis Kit and Gigapack III Gold Cloning Kit, 200403 (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX).
Clones are named for their 96-well plate identity and position during processing (for instance ra40e04.y1).
The traditional view is that arthropods are more closely related to annelids than to nematodes, but some recent molecular phylogenies place nematodes and arthropods together in a high-level taxon named Ecdysozoa, which does not include annelids [ 24 25 ] . Other molecular studies give conflicting results [ 26 27 ] . Regardless of the evolutionary relationship between Nematoda and Arthropoda, C. elegans and Drosophila remain useful and valid models for our analyses, and the relationships shown in Figure 1are consistent with both hypotheses.
Meloidogyne sequences from NCBI dbEST ( M. incognita , M. javanica and M. hapla sequences, named NMi, NMj, and NMh respectively) were translated in six frames and individually compared to conceptual six-phase translations of the C. elegans and Drosophila genomes as well as all available bacterial sequences.
The starting point for our studies was a reference set of 24 Drosophila pre-miRNA sequences ( let-7 , the 21 originally identified by Lagos-Quintana and colleagues, mir-125 , and a previously undescribed paralog of mir-2 that we named mir-2c [ 9 10 29 ] ). We analyzed this set to derive rules and determine parameters that specifically describe known miRNA genes within anonymous genomic sequence.
Interestingly, phages have been shown to carry ORFs named 'morons' (because they add more DNA to the phage genome), which often have unknown functions, but are thought to occasionally confer benefit to the host when the prophage is integrated in its genome [ 22 ] . These genes undergo high mutation and nonhomologous recombination rates, and often display high A+T-content, even in comparison to the phage itself [ 22 23 ] . Most LTGs fit this description and may therefore have been introduced into the genome by phages.
A number of public efforts are currently focusing on the annotation and curation of gene-specific functional data, including LocusLink, Protein Information Resource (PIR), GeneCards, Proteome, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Ensembl, and Swiss-Prot to name but a few [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ] . These resources provide exceptional depth and coverage of the functional data available for a given gene, but are not designed to effectively explore the biological knowledge associated with hundreds or thousands of genes in parallel.
It concluded the section specified four categories of prohibited activities, of which "three appear[ed] to prohibit the type of activity named regardless of viewpoint, while one might be read to prohibit the activity only when it seeks reform."
LSC also launched companion initiatives-the quality initiative, the diversity initiative, technology initiative grants, to name just a few -that worked hand-in-glove with state planning to promote the development of high-quality delivery systems.
Although the named client is usually an adult, most LSC cases also involve and benefit children.
Establishment of a new public interest fellowship program named in honor of Judge Coffin, supported with funding by the twelve largest law firms in Portland.
often refer to these initiatives as state planning's companion initiatives, and these initiatives - competition, the quality initiative, the diversity initiative, technology initiative grants, the matters initiative, our efforts to enhance services for self-represented litigants, the Legal Resource Library, to name just a few - have become as important to the creation of a world-class delivery system as state planning has proved itself to be.
The Clean Air Act recognizes visibility as an important public good in naming visibility as one of the aspects of public welfare to be protected in setting secondary NAAQS.
OMB, NIST, and agency responsibilities regarding information security were recently reemphasized in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, formerly named the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996.
The act requires that auditors for each of the 24 departments and agencies named in the CFO Act report, as part of their annual audits of the agencies« financial statements, whether the agencies« financial management systems comply substantially with federal financial management systems requirements, applicable federal accounting standards, and SGL at the transaction level.
6Although this view is named after the 19th century economist David Ricardo who first explored the possible relationship, the seminal work on this theory is Robert Barro, "Are Government Bonds Net Wealth?"

Last year a conservative writer named Richard Brookhiser published a biography, titled Founding Father: Rediscovering George Washington , which made the point that Washington, by keeping in mind his carefully inscribed numbered Rules throughout his momentous life, conducted himself correctly in all the Little Ways (no bedewing of others with Spittle, Hats properly Doffed, and so forth), which led to right conduct in the Big Ways, too, thus to political and military triumph.
John Lewis Gaddis, the most eminent of America's Cold War historians, has taken a risk by naming his book We Now Know .

The novel itself, Roth's fulmination against American innocence, is mostly a portrait of a single personage, a New Jersey ladies'-glove manufacturer named Seymour Levov, "the Swede"--a husband and father of exasperating conventionality, serene, handsome, athletic, bland, shallow, a man who seems to have been extracted, as if by a blender, from the onion-and-garlic world of the immigrant Jews, until every last hint of taste and texture have finally disappeared.

The lazy, vegetating existence in the depths of a moral and mental bohemia; the fundamental arrogance which thinks itself too good for any sensible and honorable activity, on the ground of its vague intuition that it is reserved for something else--as yet quite indefinite, but something which, if it could be named, would be greeted with roars of laughter.

An example--not to be cruel, but just to show what I'm getting at--could be seen at the New York Philharmonic debut, a couple of months ago, of a violinist named Frank Peter Zimmermann, from Germany.
For his first film, A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), North wrote Hollywood's first jazz soundtrack, the musical embodiment of New Orleans' moist, hot nights.
Take North's celebrated score for A Streetcar Named Desire : The score's brilliance lies in the way the languorous New Orleans jazz, redolent of sin, plumes out of the dive up the street from the Kowalskis', curls along the block, and squeezes itself through a radio.

Matthew McConaughey--who plays Ellie's love interest, the ridiculously named Palmer Joss, a former priest who is now the respected author of a best-selling book about "faith" and "meaning," and who, though still in his 20s, is a trusted adviser to the president--thrusts out his lower jaw like a calendar pinup while delivering such lines as "I'm not against technology, I'm against the men who deify it at the expense of human truth!"
At the start, the camera glides over Manhattan into New Jersey while a narrator (Robert De Niro, who turns out to be an Internal Affairs cop named Mo Tilden) informs us that New York City policemen have always dreamed of living outside the metropolis itself, "where the shit couldn't touch 'em," and that Garrison was such a refuge--a city on a hill, with a large population of cops, no minorities, and almost no crime.

There's a Jewish tradition of naming kids after ...
HANKUS: Actually, my mother had to name me after a relative whose name started with an "H" and she didn't like any of the American names like Howard or Harry or any of that sort of stuff, so she got this name from a cartoon show, as a matter of fact.
FELDMAN: What cartoon had a character named "Hankus"?
FELDMAN: OK--the question is, "What famous cartoon horse is your son named after?"

Along the way, Neal had married or maybe just kidnapped a Scandinavian-extracted girl from Kenosha named Inga.
In recent weeks, the British press has been filled with articles asking whether the inventor of Big Brother was a hypocrite for naming names.
The apparent point of the piece was not to challenge his reputation but rather to argue that those who named names before the House Un-American Activities Committee weren't so bad, since they did only what Orwell had done in a time of difficult choices.
Many of those on his list are people Orwell wrote against in the Tribune and in his "London Letter" for Partisan Review . There is no analogy to the behavior of those like Elia Kazan, who named names before House Un-American Activities Committee.

In Redmond, you people are charged only with the momentous decision of choosing whether to name new software programs "Three-Point-Three" or "Four-Point-Oh."
The original Winnie-the-Pooh was the mascot of a Canadian regiment, an actual living bear named for the city of Winnipeg.

Siskel gave Armageddon a "thumbs up" and named it his "flick of the week" on Sneak Previews .
Siskel named it his "Flick of the Week" not on television but in the Chicago Tribune , where he reviews one film a week at length.

You could wait for video, but if you can find Pig in the City playing anywhere on a big screen--an hour away, in a strip mall, only at 2 p.m., in the middle of a blizzard--see it, because you'd have to go back to the silents to find its like visually, and no silent picture could have had this kind of soundtrack.

For decades, Kazan has been reviled as the most notorious of those who "named names"--identified Communists working in Hollywood--before the House Committee on Un-American Activities.
In recent years, both the American Film Institute and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association have turned Kazan down for honors that no one disputes are merited by his films, which include East of Eden and A Streetcar Named Desire . But this time the vote in Kazan's favor was unanimous.
Since the committee already knew the names it wanted, "naming names" was a loyalty test and humiliation ritual, not part of a real investigation.
The names included Odets, who subsequently named names himself, and several actors since forgotten, in part, perhaps, because they were blacklisted.
After all, Odets gave HUAC the same names, as did Lewis Leverett, another Group Theater alumnus whom Kazan named.
But many others who named names did so under ostensible protest, or later castigated themselves publicly for crawling before the committee.

English speakers adopted the French name and talked about the Platte River . They named one of the towns on its banks North Platte . But when the state applied for admission to the Union in 1867, it was under the original Indian name which they spelled Nebraska .
According to Stupey, similar but less commercial names include Chanesa named after the three children of a railroad man, Charlie, Nellie , and Sarah ; and Edruvera , also named after three children, Edwin, Ruth , and Vera . Three adult sisters, Daisy, Cora , and Nora , were honored at Dacono.

Anna S. Wilson was honored at Anness and Ellen Woods at Lenwood, Glendora and Evadale were named to honour early husband-and-wife settlers, Glen and Dora and Eva and Dale .
Enon is none, Saxet is Texas , and Reklaw is Walker : there was already a siding named Walker and so when the same name was again suggested, the clerk in the office just reversed it.
The main reason for the reversals was that they allowed a man to name a siding after himself without appearing to be egocentric.
One man was too humble to have a siding named after him.
When he declined the offer, the workers said he was “mucho modesto,” and they decided to honor him indirectly by naming the siding Modesto , now the name of a good-sized city.
Tenino was named for the number “1090,” but there is disagreement on its significance.
There is an unconfirmed story that Laredo , Texas, was named for the sounds made by the chimes in the Catholic church: la, re , and do . Another folk etymology has it that the Snake River was so named because it coiled back and forth so much.
The truth is, however, that it was named after the Snake Indians of that area; and it is further true that the Snake Indians got their name from their habit of eating snakes: that part of the United States was very poor, and snakes were often the only food available.
Staten Island , New York was named after the legislative governing body of the Netherlands, the Staten-General , perhaps because a meeting was held there in 1776 in which American and British representatives tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a peaceful end to the American Revolution.
Some American cities are named after animals.
The town was Ptarmigan , Alaska, named after a wild bird common to the area.
Many city names express hope, as in New Hope , and New Freedom , Pennsylvania, New Era , Michigan, and the dozens of cities named Paradise . Once in a while, however, a place gets a dysphemistic name, such as the Badlands in South Dakota, or Great Dismal Swamp , which is a 1500-square-mile section of Virginia and North Carolina.
It is just for amusement that the residents of Ann Arbor, Michigan write “A²” instead of Ann Arbor in their return addresses; or people in New Hampshire joke about the towns named Orange, Lebanon , and Lyme ; or a motel owner in Comfort, Texas, which happens to be near two towns named Alice and Louise , puts up a billboard saying, “Sleep here in Comfort between Alice and Louise.”

Eleva , Wisconsin, is said to have been named by the whim of a snowstorm.
The original name was “Tight Ass Canyon,” named because of the narrowness of the pass.
Then they named the neighboring country which is actually covered with ice--over 10,000 feet deep in places-- Greenland . It might have been Eric the Red who bestowed the verdant name “Greenland” upon the usually snow-and-ice covered country.
We see this in the way that postmasters increased their fame by naming post offices after their businesses.
Also the “dialects” of China, such as Southern Min (Taiwanese) and Cantonese, to name just two, show varying relationships with the dominate tongue.
All the original “laws” were there, and I was cited as “the authority” for Borkowski's Law: You can't guard against the arbitrary . It is named after a friend of mine who said it in a drunken stupor.
Consistent with Sorokin's cyclical theory of social change, our time bears an uncanny resemblance to the first century A.D. when a Roman named Martial was penning his epigrams.
As for the “one-or-two-word” problem, Walter Scott wrote Redgauntlet (1824) and John Buchan (again) named his novel of Scottish adventure Huntingtower (1922).
A Bro Purvis is a libidinous clergyman, named after an evangelist who once whipped both of our husbands into a frenzy of desire when we were visiting a fundamentalist church with relatives.
And the expression gone with the wind antedated Margaret Mitchell's book--indeed, she so named the book because of the cliché, not the other way round; a cursory check of my Bloomsbury Thematic Dictionary of Quotations (1988--nudge!
I had never noticed it before, but the reason that the old-fashioned bicycle was named the penny-farthing was that the large front wheel bore the same proportion to the tiny one at the rear as a (British) penny bore to a farthing.
I have also read an equal number of disclaimers that pooh-pooh (as it were) the idea of such a named person ever having had anything to do with the creation of this necessary convenience (unorthodoxymoron).
The name-magic belief in this case was that a child named after an admired figure might cause some of that person's qualities to be passed on to the child.
In paragraph three we are told that “the Dare family named the first white baby born in Virginia Virginia, not a conventional name in the late sixteenth century but hardly daring considering the religious association.
’ As Professor Ashley knows, the state was named in honor of Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, and not for the Virgin Mary.
As for the “daring’ aspect, had the child been named Virginia in a Puritan community, it would certainly have been very provocative.
Piazza di Spagna , site of the Spanish Steps, is so named because since the 17th century it has been the location of the Spanish embassy to the Holy See.
Via del Babuino , running north from Piazza di Spagna, is named after an ancient fountain with a statue of Silenus, the grotesque drunken follower of Bacchus, which seemed to resemble a baboon.
Via di Ripetta imperceptibly merges into Via della Scrofa `Street of the Sow,' named after another ancient sculpture that is still preserved there.
Via Venti Settembre `20th of September Street' illustrates the Italian propensity for naming streets after historic dates, in this case the date of the breach in the ancient fortification wall of Rome, through which Italian troops stormed the city to bring the Risorgimento to an end.
Via del Plebiscito, the street that connects Piazza Venezia with Largo Argentina, now almost totally surrendered to buses and taxis, was named for the `plebiscite' held in 1870, shortly after the events of the 20th of September, when the people of Rome voted to join the rest of Italy, ending the temporal power of the Church.
Via Veneto , site of the American Embassy and of la dolce vita in general, was named for one of the provinces of the newly unified Italy, as were other streets nearby ( Via Toscana, Via Lombardia, Via Campania, etc .), when what had been the gardens of the Villa Ludovisi were urbanized almost exactly a hundred years ago.
The grandiose Via dell'Impero that was rammed through the central archaeological zone in the 1930s was named after the short-lived Fascist “Empire” in Africa.
This is the exotic-sounding Via Amba Aradam , named after a plateau in Ethiopia, a battlefield in 1936.
At the base of the Aventine, a postwar park has been named the Parco della Resistenza dell'Otto Settembre , commemorating the heroic action against the Nazis there on that date in 1943 by the Italian partisans.
Nearby, just outside the ancient wall, the area in front of the railroad station has been named Piazzale dei Partigiani . Luigi Einaudi, the patriarch of postwar Italian politics, President of the Republic from 1948 to 1955, when he was an octogenarian, has the unusual honor of a street named for him in the heart of the city, near the central railway station.

Since quadrangle maps are named for the most prominent feature on the map, he had difficulty trying to explain his choice of name.
The Sherman quadrangle is named after the town of Sherman.
It is not possible to name the Sherman quadrangle the Faywood quadrangle because there already is a Faywood Station quadrangle adjacent to the Sherman quadrange.
It was named after Sherman.
The first oil well in the United States was drilled in 1859, by Edwin L. Drake, near Titusville, Pennsylvania, a town named for Jonathan Titus, who settled it in 1796 (and wanted to call it Edinburgh).
In the 1940s my father, a certified public accountant in Boston, acquired a client named Morris Kaplan, an affable, outgoing insurance salesman (pronounced SALE-ess-mahn) whose accent reflected his origins in the Pale of Settlement, specifically in Minske Gebernyeh: Mr. Kaplan was an echt Litvak.
A poor man named John Cordeaux was brazen enough to suggest [May 27, 1893] that stoat is from the Anglo-Saxon steort , a tail.
As one might expect, much of the pleology of English can be ascribed to its propensity for naming things: many--indeed, most--of the names of organic and inorganic chemicals, numbering in the tens of thousands, are not listed in even the largest general dictionaries; nor are the names of all insects (of which, I seem to recall, there are more than 50,000 species) and plants.
We are all familiar with the naming process, whether it be with the great relief at hearing the doctor say “muscular strain” instead of “rheumatoid arthritis” as he examines the x-rays, with the Sunday supplement newspaper article summing up (for the umpteenth time) the latest new words and acronyms, with nothing with amusement, admiration, or consternation what some people name their children, and with scores of other instances we encounter daily.
Inventions and discoveries are named after the fact.

A number of them might have been created by prisoners whose vocabularies were too small to accommodate the concepts, events, or situations named.
The etymological game being what it is--( requiescat in ) pace John Ciardi--I fully expect someone to come up with an origin for cute as a button that identifies it with the six adorable daughters of some 17th-century Londoner named Button or, just to make it more complicated, a corruption of the expression *acute as a bouton in which bouton means `stud with a sharp point'--in other words, originally equivalent to sharp as a tack .
Unimaginative 141 U.S. municipalities are named Fairview (43 different states); there are 47 Jackson Townships in Indiana alone; 1,365 streams are named Mill Creek.

, MAD-rid, New York, for Madrid , BER-lin, Connecticut, for Berlin , and PEER, South Dakota, for Pierre ). It is perhaps understandable that those who undertake the creation of a complete record of American toponymy have chosen to deal with the estimated 3,000,000 named streets and highways across the land as a separate project.
Why not name your son Jesus?
You can name him Joseph Mary or Paul Mary , and nobody will think the less of him.
I have even heard of country boys named Circuncisión , but I have never met one.
And was Barrasso so named for playing bottomless?
According to some authorities, when the present capital of New Mexico was founded by Spanish colonizers in 1610, it was named La Villa Real de Santa Fe de San Francisco de Asís . In later versions this grandiloquent title, really more a dedication than a name, sometimes has the definite article la inserted between de and Santa , which changes the meaning from Saint Francis of Assisi's Royal City of Holy Faith to the Royal City of the Holy Faith of Saint Francis of Assisi . In modern times at least, and possibly since its founding, the capital, no longer royal, has been known simply as Santa Fe . Since Romance derivatives of Latin sanctus mean holy as well as saint , the Spanish name today, like the same name for several towns in countries of Spanish culture, means in English `Holy Faith.
By whatever name, Santa Fe is nestled in the foothills of a cordilleran spur called the Sangre de Cristos . No one really knows how this mountain range came to be named for the Blood of Christ, but educated guesses are not lacking.
A more probable explanation attributed to a thoughtful historian named Bill Tate is that cruciform crevasses, in winter filled with snow, that are visible on the mountainside from San Gabriel, the first Spanish capital, reminded Juan de Oñate, the leader of the first successful Spanish colonizing expedition, of the cross he wore to symbolize membership in a lay religious order devoted to reverence for the Precious Blood of Christ.
So the recently constructed loop around the inner city has been named Paseo de Peralta . The thoroughfare entering town from the south that was originally called Telegraph Street because the telegraph line ran along it and was later renamed College Street because St. Michael's College was built there is now romantically called Old Santa Fe Trail .
It is in the often hastily constructed and hastily named developments on the edges of Santa Fe that the names are most feverishly given.
Though there are plenty of examples to show that some namers of streets in Santa Fe are aware that in Spanish a definitive modifier follows the modified word, so that there are streets properly named, for instance, Camino Cerrito, Calle Lorca , or Plaza Fatima , there are other street names that betray oblivion to this grammatical rule, for example: Monte Vista Place or Cielo Vista Court where Monte Vista and Cielo Vista are supposed to mean respectively Mountain View and Sky View but, so far as they signify anything, really mean View Mountain and View Sky or Heaven . Even more common in Santa Fe are names in which adjectives fail to agree as to gender with the nouns they modify, for example: Calle Largo, Calle Lejano , or Calle Contento . This error may be due in part to the English tendency to reduce all unaccented final vowels to schwa and in part due to the fact that Spanish adjectives are listed in dictionaries in their masculine forms only.
Some animals are named from a comparison to another animal.
' Early explorers on the islands found great numbers of large dogs there and named the archipelago after them, from the Latin canis `dog.
, harbor, named for its resemblance to a fish, the gurnet.
Many of the pages are not numbered, and a number of the callouts (labels, that is) on the illustrations are not even entered into the main text of the dictionary, to wit, number 8, fly-half, nose tackle, tight end, wide receiver, safety, linebacker, cornerback , to name a few.
They belong to a linguistic stock termed Eskimo-Aleut (or `Eskaleut'), named for its two major branches.
Whether one chooses to use this term or the traditional term depends, I suppose, on how sensitive one is to the wishes of people (or of their leaders) regarding the way they are named.
They were named for their location in Vauxhall, south of the Thames.
Some time ago I was creating a document for a client, using a program which I will not name to protect the guilty, although it was--and still is, by general consent (my own included)--the best of the pack.
He has to name everything, but before being able to name, he has to recognise and classify concepts, to enclose the whole Universe in a system of notation: produce enumerations, hierarchies and paradigms.

It is as if in a particular neighborhood one family were named Jones, another Jones-Smith, and a third Smith-Jones and, because of this peculiar set of circumstances, their friends spent most of their time trying to distinguish one family from the other instead of enjoying their company.
In fact, one of the less reputable wine producers immediately named one of its abominable sparkling wines fuddle-duck . No reduplication there.
Frank Abate (“Unraveling the American Place-Name Cover” [XVIII,2]) missed a few choice names: there is a village (though without a post office) named Obtuse , Connecticut; many know about Truth-or-Consequences , New Mexico, named for an old quiz show.

I myself have known people named Busa , which in Salvatore Battaglia's Grande Dizionario Della Lingua Italiana (the Italian equivalent of the Oxford English Dictionary) is defined as “il sterco bovino,” literally, `cow dung.
' I went to high school--a small school with only a minority of Italians--with a girl named Pochintesta ( poco `little,' in `in,' testa `head'), another named Zucchi (a plural form of zucca `squash,' or, colloquially, `head'; Hanks and Hodges say this name was often given to a person of “scarce intelligence,” as in “pumpkinhead”), one boy named Chiappa (`buttock'), and another named Chiappinelli (which may be either an extended diminutive of Chiappa or the diminutive of chiappino , which Battaglia defines as a `type of ape').

The animal kingdom provided a rich source: Gallos (gallo `cock or rooster') either sang well or had active sexual lives, Gazzas and Gazzanis (gazza `magpie') and Malpighis ( male `bad,' piga a dialect word for `magpie') made a habit of gossiping or “collecting” things, and many Calendris and Calandrinos ( calandra `lark') were so named because people believed larks to be remarkably witless.
One lacking in imagination could use Povero (`poor') or Scarso (`scarce') to name a pauper or a miser.
Sometimes one needs to name the right names in the search for an equivalent proverb:
..a fine quality of cigar, named from Havana, the capital of Cuba, fondly supposed to be made there
Elmers, the nickname for homicidal maniacs similar to the well-publicized one named Elmer .
But surely there are more interesting ways in which streets can be named.
For example, they could be named after American (or foreign) cities, American states, constellations, foreign countries, American and foreign statesmen, famous operas, opera singers, composers, works of fiction, music, and art, novelists, poets, and other writers, artists, characters in fiction or mythology, trees, flowers, animals, etc. --the supply is almost inexhaustible.
Moreover, if it is deemed advisable to have the names in alphabetical order to make it easy to find a given street, it would be a simple matter to put Karachi Street between Istanbul and Lisbon Streets, Bach Boulevard between Jerusalem and Copland Boulevards followed by Debussy . If the inhabitants are predominantly of a particularly ethnic stock, they might like to commemorate Italian painters, Spanish poets, or Greek playwrights; if they are of a classical bent, they can find names of important works of Latin and Greek literature; on the other hand, if they like modern music, they can name their streets after rock groups or stars.
Was Bank Street named after someone named Bank, because it was near the bank of a river (which has now been moved three blocks away because the land was filled in), because the town bank was once on it, or because it was where they used to bank fires?

One would expect that a certain amount of common sense be exercised: Palm Drive and Bougainvillea Boulevard would be as out of place in Massachusetts as Yucca Lane; with the devastation wrought by Dutch elm disease, one might consider renaming all the streets in America named Elm Street to describe a hardier species.
In this vein, I do not advocate naming a street Bubo Boulevard or Plague Place . In Bridgeport, Connecticut, I have seen a Lesbia Street , which arouses all sorts of untoward speculation.
The road leading to Laurel Heights (where the editorial offices of VERBATIM are situated and which is, believe it or not, somewhat elevated from the surrounding land, a laurel or two can actually be found there, too) is named Boggy Hole Road, an apt name till a year ago or so, when the town of Old Lyme rebuilt it, widened it, paved it, and provided it with drainage; it is now in such good condition that I have suggested that the name be changed to Boggy Hole Boulevard, an idea that has not found much favor at the town hall.
The Choctaw said, Apalachi `helpers, allies'; the Blackfoot, Atsina `Good people' the Nootka, also, inadvertently named the Wakash, saying, “Good = waukash `good' just as the Sheepscot named the Wannoak by saying they were nopesawenoak `warriors'; the Pomo said of their southwestern cousins, the Kashaya, that they were kashaya `nimble, quick,' by way of praise, blame, or mere description.

that once practised head-flattening; and the Yellowknife , an Algonquian people living east of Great Slave Lake, Canada, were so named from their use of copper implements: pedestrian names, these, in which inventiveness played no part.
This consideration of the varying ways in which the physiological features of brows, lids, and lashes are perceived in some languages, despite their possibility of being objectively observed, is part of the larger question of how the parts of the body are named.
And was Barrasso so named for playing bottomless?
Oxymorons in general, he says, are well named, and he is against them.
The hot wind that blew from the interior, later to be named the sirocco, was known with vivid simplicity as the hot wind.
One will have noticed that there has been no reference to the indigenous inhabitants-- the Indians, natives, Papuans, Blacks, or Aborigines, as they were variously named.
Rehov Dizengoff, one of Tel Aviv's main streets, is usually shortened to Dizengoff or even Dizi , which might mislead a tourist into believing it was named after Benjamin Disraeli instead of Meir Dizengoff, the city's first mayor.
It is they, therefore, as much as anybody, who are to blame for the continuing fiction that Abingdon means `town of the abbey,' that Boston is named for St. Botolph, that Coventry means `place of the abbey,' that the second word of Leighton Buzzard represents French beau désert, that Lichfield means `field of the corpses,' that Maidstone means `Medway town,' that Morpeth means `moor path,' that Redruth means `town of the Druids,' that Southend is so called because it is at the southern end of Essex, that Westminster is a `minster' west of St. Paul's Cathedral, and so on.
Abingdon means `Æbba's hill'; Boston means `Bōtwulf's stone'; Conventry means `Cofa's tree'; Leighton Buzzard is named for the Busard family, who owned land here in the 13th century; Lichfield means `open land near Letocetum,' the latter name itself meaning `gray wood'; Maidstone probably means `stone of the maidens' (i.e.
Cambridge (Cambridgeshire) is not named for the Cam.
The river is named for the town, and the town's original name (in modern terms) was Grantabridge.
Cambridge is named in some Old English records as Grantcheste, `Roman camp on the Granta.
Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is not so named because it was founded by King Edwin of North-umberland (reigned 617-33).
Flamborough Head (Humberside) is not so named from the flames of a beacon here.
Liverpool (Merseyside) is not named for its fabled `liver bird,' despite the latter's representation in the city's coat of arms.
Oakham (Leicestershire) is not named for its oaks but means `Occa's homestead' or `Occa's riverside land,' depending whether the second half of the name represents Old English hām or hamm .
But whereas the changes wrought in French by the French Revolution were canceled by the Thermidorean reaction, in the newly formed and freshly named Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (more commonly called the USSR or, in Cyrillic, CCCP ) wholesale changes of toponyms, following changes of personal names, did not really set in till the Soviet Thermidor brought Stalin to dictatorial power.
So as Ilyich's body was eternalized in embalming fluids (or duplicated in wax, as some skeptics believe) and displayed much like the relics of saints under an impressive mausoleum in Red Square against the Kremlin wall, the city created by the westernizing tsar and named for himself with a western, German name, Sankt-Peterburg , was renamed Leningrad.
“It's a hawkmoth .” But she had already named it.
The confusion can be avoided by using the moth's Latin name which was established two hundred years ago by a natural scientist named Carolus Linnaeus, and by the two-name namers who followed after him.
A brown and yellow butterfly with blue “eyes” on its front wings is called the common wood nymph , or the wood satyr . Other lepidopterists named the wood satyr the blue-eyed grayling , others, the goggle eye . Who is right?
The two-shilling coin was known as a florin, named after a medieval gold coin from Florence, Italy.
Microbiologists laughed and laughed: in the first place, nobody but the official committee on nomenclature is authorized to change a bacterial name; second, Salmonella is recognized internationally, not just in the U.S.; and third, the bacterium was named not after the fish but after an American bacteriologist, Daniel E. Salmon (1850-1914).
Gone is the time when one might make a reasonably accurate guess at a person's race or nationality by his name; today, when blacks who do not adopt Arabic names or names like Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones might be named Kelly or Murphy, Jews born as Greenberg change their name to Monteverdi or Vermont, Hirsch to Cerf, and so forth, and people with Slavic and Italian names either change its spelling in an attempt to get people to pronounce it as closely as possible to the original (e.g.
Indeed, in the book Schindler's List, there are two persons named Schindler: Oskar Schindler, the protagonist, who was a Catholic Sudetendeutscher (ethnic German from Bohemia or Moravia); and a Brigadier Schindler, an official with the Wehrmacht procurement office in Berlin (who one presumes was not Jewish).
So does the former name for the colony, Van Diemen's Land (so named by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman), or its facetious variant, Vandemonia (former Tasmanian convicts being known on the mainland as Vandemonians).
The piner once lived in a badger box , a makeshift shelter named in allusion to the wombat's capacious hole in the ground (the wombat being known uniquely in Tasmania as a badger, to which it bears a passing resembalance).
But one is given to wonder about the treatment of Geiger counter , which we know is a radiation counter developed by the German physicist Hans Geiger (evidently working with someone named Müller, whose given name appears to have disappeared but who once shared the honors, as the former name of the device was Geiger-Müller counter ): this is described as a translation of Geigerzahler [lit.

No Boys Named Sue, But.
Which is the whole point of the song “A Boy Named Sue.”
Yet some centuries before there was a boy named Anne : the full-bearded face of Anne de Montmorency 1493-1567, soldier, courtier, Constable of France, gazes from his portrait with supreme aristocratic confidence.
It is true that from the earliest times she was also known as Juliana , and all variants of this great Roman clan name have always been popular, from a former Queen of the Netherlands to the delicious Julienne soup, named after a female cook.
Could he, by the remotest chance, have been the inspiration for “A Boy named Sue”?
He may be taking some pleasure in the possible recent discomfiture of the previously appropriately named Farmer Veale , in the wake of the campaign against live calf exports from the United Kingdom.
There is a notion favored by the bureaucrats in Brussels that products should not be named after a place or sound like some original thing such as champagne or cheddar cheese unless they come from that place.

Somewhat to his surprise and that of others in the party, the Aborigines of Port Jackson (as Sydney Harbour was named) did not recognize the word.
Cat ice is a thin layer of ice on a puddle from under which water has receded, so named because it will bear only the weight of a cat, or a catling , a kitten walking over it cat-footed to avoid breaking it.
William Safire, the political and language columnist for the New York Times , has been concerned about the correct use of the apostrophe and s with proper nouns ending in s , particularly with eponyms, so concerned that he has named a syndrome for himself: Safire's syndrome --`the urge to correct.
Dorland's Medical Dictionary , 26th edition (1974), devotes more than nineteen columns to short definitions of diseases, the vast majority eponymous, seven named for physicians who early described hyperthyroidism.
Some processes are named for early reporters, as is Graves, and some for victims as Lou Gehrig (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), usually without their permission or even awareness.
But Gib, Phip , and Wat survive in patronymics: Gibson, Gibbons, Gibbs; Phipps; Watson, Watkins, Watts . Electrical watts were named for the Scottish engineer James Watt, and readers will recall Wat Tyler's Rebellion of 1381.
Aluminium is so spelled outside North America (except by the Canadian aluminum giant, Alcan Aluminium ). The metal was identified in 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy, who originally named it alumium , based on Latin alumen , and alum , oxides and sulphates of aluminum, respectively, which were known to the ancients.
It is not considered proper to name elements after oneself, but others can name an element after you if you are dead and sufficiently famous.

Elements named after scientists include Curium, Mendelevium, Einsteinium, Nobelium (actually this was named after Sweden's Nobel Institute, not directly after Alfred Nobel), and Lawrencium . However, there is another element whose nomenclature breaks the rules thanks to a trick its discoverer played on the world.

The committee was named the Standing Committee on Spoken English in 1954, Mitchell and Delbridge being successive chairmen of SCOSE during its formative years.
The pub is named after a bird common in the Broads, the grey heron Ardea cinerea , known locally as the harnser . We do not mistake it for a hawk, a plasterer's board with a handle underneath (called, interestingly enough, oiseau in French).
Hilary Howard got her reds mixed in “No Boys Named Sue, But.
The most aptly named individual I have ever encountered was a dentist who, early in this century, had his office in Netwark, New Jersey.
Her book establishes a framework for such analysis designed both to describe sexism in a text and, through a process she names “feminist stylistics,” to deconstruct the way in which point of view, agency, metaphor, and other features of the text “are unexpectedly closely related to matters of gender.”
To those who bemoan the loss of the chastity of the French language, all I can say is that the lady never was a virgin: French is essentially mutated Latin corrupted by Arabic, Gaulish, and Germanic, to name a few of the seducers.
At least since Lewis Carroll intrigued his readers with “Jabberwocky,” there have been writers—Robert Heinlein and Dr. Seuss, to name two—who deliberately minted new words.
biff to notify someone of incoming mail [named after the implementor's dog barked whenever the mailman came].
This has resulted in such products as a brand of jeans called Trim Pecker , lawn fertilizer called Green Piles, Cow Brand shampoo, Shot Vision TV sets, Carap candy, Pocky candy, Pocket Wetty pre-moistened towelettes, and a nail-polish remover called Fingernail Remover . Two top beverages are named Calpis and Pocari Sweat , and a coffee creamer is called Creap . Slogans, too, are sometimes in English, like this one on a deodorant container: Sweet Medica—it frees you completely from the smell of your underarm sweat . Or this, on a bottle of nose drops: Nazal—for stuffed nose and snot .

The Finnish chemist Gadolin isolated a new `earth' (metallic oxide) there in 1794 and called it yttria . In 1803 the Swedish chemist Berzelius discovered another `earth' and named it cerium , for the asteroid (minor planet) Ceres.
Take just yttria . In 1843 the Swedish chemist Mosander analysed this `earth' into yttrium proper, erbium , and terbium , all named for Ytterby.
In 1878 the Swiss chemist Marignac further isolated ytterbium , and in 1879 the Swedish chemist Cleve distinguished holmium (named for Stockholm) and thulium (from Thule, the farthest land known to the Greeks).
In 1907 the French chemist Urbain separated lutetium from ytterbium, naming it for his native Paris (Roman name Lutetia ).
(The element with atomic number 61 is not found naturally, and this number was allocated to promethium , when proof of its existence was confirmed by American chemists, who named it for Prometheus, in Greek mythology the earliest teacher and benefactor of mankind.)
Hoe cakes , originally baked on hoe, and hush puppies , allegedly so named because pieces of them were fed to dogs to keep them quite, are variations of what Southerners call corn bread and New Englanders call (spider) johnnycake: spider because it was baked in a spider , a black, cast-iron skillet.
The source is unknown; perhaps it originated when a dog named Ring was in his death throes and the family were being called.

If bird names are anything to go by, the “bowwow” theory (perhaps we should call it the “tweet-tweet” theory) rules the roost, since many birds are named for their songs or calls.
The chick , as a young bird, is named from it.
Outside the farmyard, but still (usually) within farmland territory, the crow and rook are both named for their harsh call or caw , and though less common, the chough and the raven are similarly named.
Outside the farmyard, but still (usually) within farmland territory, the crow and rook are both named for their harsh call or caw , and though less common, the chough and the raven are similarly named.
Elsewhere afield, the curlew , with its cry of courli , is obviously named, as is the cuckoo , whose name is similar in many languages (French coucou , German Kuckuck , Greek kokkux , Latin cuculus ). The first part of its name is in fact directly related to that of the cock , as the initial cuck - of its call corresponds to the farmyard bird's cluck.
The male of the species, the gander , has a directly related name, as does the gannet . Its cry is described as a barking arrah . Still with the water birds, the heron is named for its harsh cry rrank; the name itself is related to that of the hen . The bittern is a further wading bird; its cry is usually described as a “boom,” and the first part of its name, from Latin butio , represents this.
On dry land, the finch is named for its prolonged nasal tswe-e-e , mostly clearly heard in the greenfinch.

Most of the elements discovered in the first exuberant wave of Enlightenment chemistry bear abbreviations close to their actual names: Ni for nickel, first identified in 1751 (an abbreviation of German Kupfernickel , `copper-demon,' so called because miners first noticed it as a stubborn adulterant of copper ore), Al for aluminum—spelled alumin i um in the British Commonwealth nations (named in 1825 from Latin alumen , `astringent substance'), Co for cobalt (isolated in 1735; the name is a variant of German Kobold , a kind of imp).
Jö;ns Jakob Berzelius, who discovered selenium (from Greek selene , `moon') in 1818 and named silicon (from Latin silex , `flint') in 1824, compiled the first systematic table of the elements in 1828, arranged according to units of atomic weight one twelfth of the heft of the commonest isotope of carbon.
Mendeleev's insight was so valuable that when radioactive elements began being synthesized in laboratories during this century, he got one named after him: Mendelevium—note the dropping of the final e!
Other scientists with eponymous atoms include the discoverers of radium, Pierre and Marie Curie (element 96, Curium, symbol Cm, discovered in 1944), Ernest O. Lawrence, founder of the Lawrence Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore laboratories (element 103, Lawrencium, symbol Lr, synthesized in 1961), and, of course, Albert Einstein (element 99, Einsteinium, symbol Es, created in 1952)—the only instance of an atom named after someone still living at the time of its discovery.
Cerium is named for the asteroid Ceres, both having been discovered the same year (1801).
National commemoratives include Americium, Germanium, Polonium and Francium; ancient France likewise gets a nod in Gallium (Ga), the only metal that melts in your hand, not in your chamber (unless you have a very warm room)—named both for Gaul (Latin Gallia, that place which, thanks to Julius Caesar's memoir of its subjugation by the Romans, every schoolchild used to know was divided into three parts) and, in a gesture of unusual levity, as a pun on the name of its discoverer, Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran.
Naturally enough, Mosander named the new element Ytterbium, after the town.
Still, they enjoy a brief existence of a sort, and names for them, honoring physicists and the locations of their laboratories, are already queued up awaiting approval by the scientific community at large: Rutherfordium for #104 (Ernest Rutherford), Dubnium for #105 (after the Russian lab at Dubna), Seaborgium for #106 (Glenn Seaborg), Bohrium for #107 (Niels Bohr), Hassium for #108 (Hesse province in Germany, where the Darmstadt lab is located) and—the first element to be named solely for a woman—Meitnerium for #109 (Lise Meitner).
Then there's pseudonym , (false name), eponym (named for a person, e.g., sandwich after Lord Sandwich), and acronym (formed from the initial letters or syllables of a group of words, e.g., snafu meaning “Situation Normal; All Fouled Up” or laser meaning “Light Amplification Stimulated Emissions Radiation”).
Lord Kelvin is credited with coining mho by reversing the spelling of ohm . An ohm is a unit of electrical resistance (named for the German physicist, Georg Simon Ohm), and a mho is a unit of conductivity of a body whose resistance is one ohm.
Fucktruck `a van or car in which people engage in sexual activity' had been mentioned in the introduction as being Australian (where it has been used since the 1960s), a statement rejected by numerous correspondents who testified to their activities in thusly named vehicles in the U.S. of A.; two people noted that the word was also used for `a bus on which one can meet prospective sexual partners' (both, curiously, referring to a shuttle between Wellesley College and the Harvard and M.I.T.

17 Today bar codes and retail information systems allow access to stocking levels on a continuous basis, but most retailers choose to use periodic review systems to restrict ordering activities to set times of the week; that way, they can save on transportation and other costs by ordering multiple products from the same vendor at the same time.
Figure . shows a hypothetical movie of a network in the ordered regime.
The point of fragmentation of the green sea into green islands constitutes a phase transition from the chaotic to the ordered regime.
Several critical features distinguish the ordered from the chaotic regime.
In the ordered regime, something magic happens.
To characterize Boolean networks with respect to the ordered and chaotic regime, it is convenient to take thousands of random pairs of states at dierent initial distances, Dt, where Dt can vary from . to .. For each pair of initial states, run the Boolean network forward one moment, discover the two successor states of the two initial states, and compute D(t + ) for that pair of initial states.
By contrast, in the ordered regime, as shown in Figure ., the Derrida recurrence curve is below the main diagonal for small Dt, that is, initial states that are close lie on trajectories that converge.
That is, when parameters discussed below are tuned from the chaotic to the ordered regime such that the green sea is just breaking up into green islands, simultaneously, the Derrida curve changes from the chaotic regime to become tangent with the main diagonal for small values of Dt.
There are other clues, reported in Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe in some detail, that support the hypothesis that cells lie in the ordered regime.
In the ordered regime, any cell type can only directly reach a few adjacent cell types and may, by a succession of perturbations, eventually dierentiate along branching developmental pathways to a larger number of cell types.
He also ordered Secretary Rumsfeld to develop a military plan against the Taliban.

The linear ordering of multiple DNA markers based upon their estimated relationships ( i.e. , recombination fraction (or genetic distance)) supplies the framework or genetic map for (composite) interval mapping [ 6 7 ] and as such unconfounds the QTL effect and the QTL location, thus providing a more precise means for detecting and locating QTL with respect to the estimated genetic map for the organism under investigation.
These clones were then ordered and analyzed to identify exon/intron junctions.

Rather than continuing to increase inventory, Compaq announced that it would only assemble its new line of personal computers as its retail customers ordered them.
Under the traditional model, retailers ordered desired products far in advance of the selling season because their apparel suppliers charged less for large runs and long lead times with long periods of advance commitment.
In this environment, ordering large quantities of products far in advance of the selling season is simply too costly.
Retailers now prefer to place relatively small orders before the season and then observe consumer response to the product offering before ordering more.
But because products are manufactured and ordered by SKU, some attempt must be made to forecast demand at that level.
A number of other straightforward costs are associated with any inventory stocking policy, such as the cost of ordering and transporting product; the cost of determining inventory levels; and the impact on purchase price of any quantity price discounts.
Lean retailers’ rapid replenishment arrangements radically reduce the risk of undersupply—the retailer can essentially “correct” for those items that it ordered too little of prior to the start of the season—and of oversupply, since the retailer orders smaller initial quantities.
To determine the optimal quantity for a SKU, the retailer finds the number of units to order so that the expected marginal cost of stocking an additional unit and not being able to sell it equals the expected marginal cost of not stocking that unit when it would have sold if available.
The buyer should order 250 units, since there is a 75 percent probability that demand will be less than this.
Note that this buyer would be ordering more than she expects to sell (the mean value of the distribution, 180 units).
The amount ordered should be sufficient so that the number of units on hand plus those that are on order equal some “maximum” stocking quantity, S.13 For a particular item, our store buyer may reorder when the inventory level falls below s equals 4 units, in a quantity that brings the current inventory up to S equals 8 units.
With this policy in place, if at the end of a day she notes that inventory has dropped to 3 units, she would order 5 more, as shown in Figure 6.7.
Instead, at the time of ordering, inventory in stock plus that on order equals eight units.
Thus, the retail replenishment system would check the stock of these jeans every Sunday night; if the current stock is thirteen pairs of size-8 jeans (meaning that four pair sold the previous week), then it would automatically order four more pairs, bringing the amount of this SKU up to its target level of seventeen units.
The moment the level hits s, the retailer orders up to a specified quantity S. Unlike a periodic-review policy, in which retailers may order when the inventory level is less than s, with a continuous-review policy, they always order when the inventory equals s.
17 Today bar codes and retail information systems allow access to stocking levels on a continuous basis, but most retailers choose to use periodic review systems to restrict ordering activities to set times of the week; that way, they can save on transportation and other costs by ordering multiple products from the same vendor at the same time.
The manufacturer must deliver the ordered product quickly to the retailer.
The alternative is to adopt quick-response manufacturing strategies that allow items to be produced to order.
Thus, if a retailer follows the simplest strategy of ordering at the beginning of each week exactly those items that sold during the previous week, manufacturers must be prepared to ship an unknown number of items each week.
It is useful to outline the ordering and manufacturing processes on a weekly basis to see how this manufacturer’s inventory policies might differ for the two different sizes.
Then, by the following Monday, the items ordered the previous week would be completed at the factory and available in the manufacturer’s finished goods inventory.
Given this manufacturer’s policy of ordering production only when inventory levels dropped below ten weeks, with the production quantity set to restore the inventory to fourteen weeks, the minimum production quantity for each item was four weeks of demand.
On receipt of the weekly orders, production managers total the quantity of each SKU ordered and determine production needs to restore each SKU’s distribution-center inventory to its target level.

The model was developed by first binning gene expression data into tight classes across the entire range of absolute expression values, where genes with an equal absolute expression value were randomly ordered, and then selecting the upper 5% of HFC values for further consideration.
• Genes are ordered according to their absolute expression value min ( Z 
Clustering expression data into groups of genes that share profiles is a proven method for grouping functionally related genes, but does not order pathway components according to physical or regulatory relationships.
The same procedure can be applied to the remaining n = 5 coordinates, the position in the backward map, to extract the identity of the succeeding units, now ordered backwards.
They then rank ordered these genes and added them 5 at a time to a one-man-out test of their 77 patients for predicted outcome.
Therefore, we tested this suggestion with our four-taxon data set of 100 proteins, ordered by rate of evolution.

Experiments using immuno-fluorescence in vertebrate cells are beginning to order the recruitment and timing of incorporation of individual nucleoporins during post-mitotic re-assembly [ 12 13 14 15 ] . Additionally, in vitro assembly studies with Xenopus egg or mitotic cell extracts have revealed several intermediates in NPC assembly and demonstrated a requirement for an intact double nuclear membrane prior to post-mitotic NPC assembly [ 16 17 18 19 ] . The modular nature of the NPC structure has also suggested that subcomplexes of discrete Nups may initially form and provide building blocks for biogenesis.
Formally speaking, it is not possible to order gene functions based on suppressive interactions involving reduction-of-function (e.g.
We have ordered these clones by identifying RPTPρ exons within each of them.

One especially important higher-level application is computerized physician order entry, in which providers write orders including prescriptions using computers [ 11 ] . Computerization of ordering is important because most actions in health care follow an order; computerizing this process allows provision of real-time decision support to providers, for example implementation of guidelines and critical pathways.
Another application that is extremely important for delivering decision support is a program called an event monitor, which sits over a database and can provide notification when an important event is found (for example, a markedly elevated serum sodium level) [ 12 ] . Even more challenging than computerizing ordering or building an event monitor, especially in the inpatient setting, is computerizing the medical record, especially capturing of notes in real time.

Of note, charges associated with diagnostic studies which were part of the donor evaluation process (eg echocardiography, hepatitis serology) and were specifically ordered by, and therefore billed to, the OPO during and after the brain death stay were not credited against the patient as brain death stay charges.
All charges accrued after the patient was declared legally brain dead, and charges for diagnostic studies specifically ordered by the OPO during the brain death stay as a part of the donor evaluation process, were the responsibility of the local OPO as per national standards (Hawthorne RV, pers comm).
The third method, that of using a cerebral blood flow scan (a technique which was previously ordered rather infrequently at our institution) in conjunction with only one brain death examination, dramatically shortens brain death stay.

Title 7 identifies the following steps of the acquisition and payment process involving general purchases: (1) purchase authorization (the ordering function), (2) receipt and acceptance of the items ordered,
1 An administrative approval is generally performed by a responsible official in the unit that ordered or received the items purchased.
The administrative approval normally is based on verification that the items ordered were actually received and met the government's specifications, and thus validates a vendor's request (invoice) for payment.
The examination consisted of several steps, primarily focusing on comparing information on three critical documents-the obligation or ordering document, the receiving and inspection document (normally called a receiving report), and the invoice.
Receipt and acceptance data could be compared electronically to the ordering and the invoice information to help ensure that payment authorization is valid and at the same time reduce the risk of errors in the process.
The agencies requesting guidance on internal controls when implementing fast pay have also designed procedures to verify receipt and acceptance of goods ordered on an afterthefact sampling basis rather than on the basis of a 100percent postpayment verification as is traditionally done.
the goods and services ordered have been delivered and accepted, evidenced by a receiving and inspection report, and (3) a claim has been made against the government as evidenced by receipt of an invoice or bill.
Three specific areas where internal control should be given special attention when authorizing payments without invoices are: (1) payment is initiated only after receipt and acceptance of ordered goods and services and is authorized only after matching the types and quantities received with those on the purchase order or contract,16 (2) controls exist to insure against duplicate payment should a vendor mistakenly seek payment for goods or services for which payment has already been made, and
