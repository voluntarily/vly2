  "description": "# NZTA Innovation Centre\n \n We have 6 model cars with sensors for vision, proximity etc, \n controlled by Arduinos teach them to solve \n 4 challenges - move, follow a line, avoid obstacles, \n get to a destination etc. \n \n ## We need:\n * Open space with room for the test tracks - e.g a school hall\n * teams of 5 students\n * on adult helper per team, should be able to follow instructions and understand a little C++\n \n ## Learning outcomes:\n * programming a remote device\n * simple coding\n * algorithmic thinking\n * problem solving.\n \n",
