We want you as a volunteer, and the young people and children
we work with to all to have brilliant experiences doing activities.

So we ask you to complete some training materials about what you can
and can't do in schools, how to behave and what to expect.

We also run a confidential background police check to verify that there
is no reason you should not be working with children.

This goal will collect the required information and permission to run the check
and then send you on a short online training course to get you briefed.
Once completed you'll receive the 'School Ready' badge and teachers will know
you are someone they can trust in their classrooms.

Don't worry if you have started the process but don't think it will be
completed in time - there are ways we can handle that.
