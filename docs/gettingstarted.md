# Getting Started

**Warning - this might not be easy if this is your first time using git, node.js, and working with code - errors might show up while following steps and googling answers to problems will probably be required.**

This guide covers some recommended ways to get yourself set up for development on the Voluntarily Platform
Refer to OS-specific guides for your machine to get started.
* [Windows](#windows)
* [MacOS](#macos)
* [Linux](#linux)


If you get stuck with errors anywhere in the process, write down what the error says, and try googling parts of the error to solve it

If you are still stuck, ask for help in the gitter channel - [Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/voluntarily/community "Chatroom")

When you find a solution, please write down what you did to solve it, and post it on the [Voluntarily Wiki](https://voluntarily.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/group/3/create/16 "Wiki")


## Windows


### Setup
1. Install Node.js on your machine if you don't have it https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Install MongoDB community server on your machine if you don't have it https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community
3. Install Visual Studio Code on your machine if you don't have it https://code.visualstudio.com/
4. Clone the voluntarily repo https://github.com/voluntarily/vly2
    1. Open up a terminal in visual studio
    2. Make sure the terminal is set to bash
    3. Find your way to a folder you want to put the files in
    4. Run the following command from the terminal ```git clone https://github.com/voluntarily/vly2.git```
    5. Create a new terminal window, and run the ```npm install``` command

### Running a dev server
1. Create a new terminal window, and run the ```net start mongodb``` command
2. Create a new terminal window, and run the ```npm run dev``` command
3. That's it! ðŸŽ‰
You can check your server is running by opening a browser and trying to visit http://localhost:3122
4. Try making some changes to the components or pages - thanks to hot reloading any chances you make and save instantly appear on the site

## MacOS

### Setup

1. Install Homebrew https://brew.sh/
2. Make sure it's running correctly by running the `brew doctor` command

4. Install Node.js on your machine if you don't have it by opening a terminal and running ```brew install node```
5. Install MongoDB on your machine if you don't have it by opening a terminal and running
      a. ```brew tap mongodb/brew``` <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>
      b. ```brew install brew install mongodb-community@4.0``` <sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>
6. Create a db directory for mongodb eg: ```sudo mkdir -p /data/db```
7. Make sure permissions are set correctly for the directory
      a. ```sudo chmod 0755 /data/db```
      b. ```sudo chown $USER /data/db```
9. Clone the voluntarily repo https://github.com/voluntarily/vly2 to your chosen directory
    * ```git clone https://github.com/voluntarily/vly2.git```
10. Open up a terminal window in the voluntarily project root and run ```npm install```
11. Open your project in your favourite code editor and start coding!
    * **Note** We suggest Visual Studio Code if you don't have one https://code.visualstudio.com/
