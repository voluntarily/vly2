# First Challenge

## Add your name to the CONTRIBUTORS

* clone the code
* edit the file
* check it in and send us a pull request

Use this ticket [VP-82](https://voluntarily.atlassian.net/browse/VP-82)

----

# What you need to get started

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
You probably already have it. Verify with `git --version`
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Verify this with `node -v` which should return a current version. e.g. v12.1.0

----

# Mongo DB

* [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

For mac users `brew install mongodb` should be all you need to do.

Start the mongodb service `mongod`

For Windows users [Click here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) for instructions on installing MongoDB and MongoDB Compass.

----

# Get the Voluntari.ly source code

    git clone https://github.com/voluntarily/vly2.git
    cd vly2
    npm install



----

# you served my father

`npm run dev` - starts the development server with hot reloading enabled

Open browser at http://localhost:3122/test
ctrl+c to exit

----

# Jedi(t)

Edit ./components/test/Hello.js and make it salute your name.

    export default (props) =>
      <p className='greeting' >
        Hello, *Your name here*!
      </p>

Save - and the test webpage should update to show your change.

----

# You're all clear, kid

`npm run lint` - runs _standard_ to check for lint errors

There should be no warnings. If there are `npm run fix` to fix most errors.

----

# Run the Tests

`npm test` - runs any AVA tests found in *.spec.js files.

----

# 1 test failed

      components › test › Hello › renders properly

      /Users/watkinsav/workspace/voluntarily/vly2/components/test/__tests__/Hello.spec.js:8

      7:   t.truthy(wrapper.find('p').first().hasClass('greeting'))
      8:   t.is(wrapper.find('p').first().text(), 'Hello, *Your name here*!')
      9: })

      Difference:

      - 'Hello, *Andrew*!'
      + 'Hello, *Your name here*!'

----


# Undo Undo
Undo the change you made to hello.js

    git checkout --  ./components/test/Hello.js

To get the original file and discard the changes you made.

Then `npm run test` again and you should get all tests passed.

# MERN, MERRANIN RAMINNER?

Voluntari.ly uses MongoDB, Node, Express, React, Redux, Next, Intl and AntD
![MERRANN](./img/mern.png)

Yes it is Javascript all the way down.
---

![Node JS](./img/node.png)

https://nodejs.org/

----
# Node

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Which means you can run Javascript outside of a browser.

Which means you can write command line and server side programmes.
----
## Which means you can write this

    // Call the console.log function.
    console.log('Hello World')

and run it

    node helloworld.js
    Hello World

----
## And this...

    // Load the http module to create an http server.
    var http = require('http')

    // Configure our HTTP server to respond with Hello World to all requests.
    var server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
      response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })
      response.end('Hello World\n')
    })

    server.listen(8001) // defaults to 127.0.0.1

    // Put a friendly message on the terminal
    console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8001/')

---

![Express JS](./img/expressjs.jpg)

https://expressjs.org/

----
# Express
We use express to handle the server side activities that will return a page for each request made and handle the API calls.

    const express = require('express')
    const app = express()
    const port = 3000

    app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'))
    app.get('/rick', (req, res) => res.send('Never going to give you up, Never going to let you down.'))
    app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`))

---

![MongoDB](./img/mongodb.png)

https://www.mongodb.com/

----
# Mongo DB
MongoDB is a document-oriented database program. Free and open source

Instead of SQL with relational rows and tables MongoDB stores JSON-like documents and provides ways to retrieve those documents based on the internal fields.

    {
      "title": "Self driving model cars ",
      "subtitle": "using algorithmns to follow lines and avoid obstacles",
      "imgUrl": "http://www.plaz-tech.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-easycart-data/products/pics1/Arduino%20Car%202_8ab5dd38f1e3f6f05ad244f1e5e74529.jpg",
      "description": "# NZTA Innovation Centre\n \n We have 6 model cars with sensors for vision..."
      "duration": "4 hours",
      "location": "NZTA Innovation Centre, 5 Cook St Auckland",
      "status": "draft"
    }

----
# Mongo in Dev & Test
For Dev we use a local database

    mongod

or you can use a docker container

    docker run --name db -d -v /data/db -p:27017:27017 mongo:latest

and set the connect string in the environment

    MONGO_URL: mongodb://db:27017/vly-dev

----
# Mongo in UAT & Prod
For Production and UAT we use a cloud hosted database:

MongoDB Atlas. https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/

and need this connect string:

    MONGO_URL: mongodb+srv://vly-client:ZhF3BUDiwpy8C3xK@cluster0-kwmsu.mongodb.net/vly-test?retryWrites=true
----

# Mongoose
The node Mongoose library gives us an easy way to make calls to the database.

We can define the document schema

    const mongoose = require('mongoose')
    const Schema = mongoose.Schema

    const organisationSchema = new Schema({
    name: { type: 'String', required: true },
    slug: { type: 'String', required: true },
    about: { type: 'String', required: true },

----
# Mongoose

Create a document of that type:

    const oppo = new Opportunity({
        title: 'The first 200 metres',
        subtitle: 'Launching into space step 2',
        imgUrl: 'https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/206/206857.svg',
        description: 'Project to build a simple rocket that will reach 200m',
    });

----

And save it to the database

    oppo.save();

---
![React](./img/reactreact.png)

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
https://reactjs.org/

----
# Declarative

Create components that look and work like HTML but can handle code and data.

    const Hello = ({ name }) => <p className='greeting' >Hello, {name}</p>
    export default Hello

Usage:

    <h1><Hello name='Andrew' /></h1>

----
# Components

Application is built from...

dumb components that just render data:

    <OpCard size-'Small' op={op} />

----
# Components
and smarter components or pages that obtain data and handle interactions

    class Ops extends Component {
      static async getInitialProps ({ store, query }) {
        // Get all Opportunities
        const ops = await store.dispatch(reduxApi.actions.opportunities.get())
        return { ops, query }
      }

      render () {
        return (<OpList ops={this.props.ops} />)
      }
    }

---

![Redux](./img/reduxredux.png)

A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

https://redux.js.org/

----
# Predictable

Redux helps us write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.
----
# Centralized

Centralizing the application's state and logic enables powerful capabilities like undo/redo, state persistence, and much more.

There is one place where all the information is held and we can access it from any component.

----
# Debuggable

The Redux DevTools make it easy to trace when, where, why, and how our application's state changed. Redux's architecture lets you log changes, use "time-travel debugging", and even send complete error reports to a server.
![DevTools](./img/reduxdevtools.png)

---

![NextJS](./img/nextjs.png)

https://nextjs.org/

----
# Next

The Next JS Framework helps us put it all together.

It is a React Framework that provides us with

* Server Side Rendering SSR
* Static exports
* CSS in JS
* minimal config
* Production friendly builds
* Use all the latest Javascript code styles

---
# Ant Design (React)

![Ant Design](./img/antd.png)

https://ant.design/

----
# A set of design values

![Ant Design Nature](./img/antdnature.png)
https://ant.design/docs/spec/values

----
# A set of components
Ant Design of React https://ant.design/components/

![Ant Design of React](./img/antdbutton.png)

----
# A set of components

    import { Button } from 'antd';

    const Buttons = () => {
        <div>
            <Button type="primary">Primary</Button>
            <Button>Default</Button>
            <Button type="dashed">Dashed</Button>
            <Button type="danger">Danger</Button>
        </div>
    }

# Internationalisation

## Voluntari.ly is multilingual
![NZ EN language flag](./img/nzenflag.jpg)
![NZ Mi language flag](./img/nzmiflag.jpg)

[Background](https://voluntarily.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VP/pages/4423681/Voluntari.ly+is+Multilingual)

----
# Use react-intl library

https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl

This library provides React components and an API to format dates, numbers, and strings, including pluralization and handling translations.

He tika i te timatanga  | it is right from the start
----
# Example - IntlDemo.js
    import { FormattedMessage, FormattedNumber } from 'react-intl'
    export default () =>
    <div>
        <h1>Test Internationalisation Formatting</h1>
        <FormattedMessage
            id='demo.greeting'
            defaultMessage='Hello World!'
            description='Use the local equivalent of Hello World.'
        />
    &nbsp;
        <FormattedNumber value={1000} />
    </div>
----
# Rules for Intl
* All strings that appear on the screen should be translatable. - use the FormattedMessage wrapper.

* Numbers, plurals, dates and times should also use their respective wrappers.

* The messages are collected automatically and the en.json file is generated. This will be profesionally translated ( Do not rely on Google)

* See the About page for how to manage whole pages of translatable content.
---
# Identity and Access Management
![Auth0](./img/auth0.jpg)

https://auth0.com/

----
# Cloud service for identity

Get somone else to do the work for:
* registration,
* email validation,
* sign in/out,
* password reset,
* social logins (Google, LinkedIn)
* OAuth, SAML, AD etc.
